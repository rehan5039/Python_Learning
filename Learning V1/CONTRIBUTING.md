## 📋 Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/):

```python
# ✅ Good
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle."""
    return length * width

# ❌ Bad
def calc_area(l,w):
    return l*w
```

### Code Comments

- Use clear, descriptive comments
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Keep comments updated with code

```python
# ✅ Good comment
# Calculate discount for bulk orders (10+ items)
discount = 0.15 if quantity >= 10 else 0

# ❌ Bad comment
# Set discount
discount = 0.15 if quantity >= 10 else 0
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples
- Add emoji for visual appeal (but don't overdo it)
- Structure with headers and sections

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Update README.md** if needed
2. **Ensure all code runs** without errors
3. **Follow the existing structure** and style
4. **Update the course table of contents** if adding lessons
5. **Write a clear PR description**:
