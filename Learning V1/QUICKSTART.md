## 🛠️ Essential Tools

### Must-Have
- **Python 3.12+**: The language itself
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Where you write code
- **Terminal/Command Prompt**: Where you run code

### Nice-to-Have
- **Git**: Version control
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolate project dependencies
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding

## 🎯 Learning Tips for Beginners

### DO ✅
- **Type code yourself** - Don't copy-paste
- **Run examples** - See how code works
- **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens
- **Make mistakes** - That's how you learn
- **Ask questions** - No question is stupid
- **Practice daily** - Even 20 minutes helps

### DON'T ❌
- **Rush through** - Understanding > Speed
- **Memorize everything** - Learn concepts, not syntax
- **Skip exercises** - Practice is essential
- **Get discouraged** - Everyone struggles at first
- **Compare yourself** - Your pace is your pace
