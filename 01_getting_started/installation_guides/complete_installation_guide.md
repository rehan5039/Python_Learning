## üõ† Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command" (Windows)
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. Restart your command prompt
3. If still not working, add Python to PATH manually:
   - Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows search
   - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add these paths:
     - `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\`
     - `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts\`
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual username and `3x` with your Python version

### Issue 2: "command not found: python3" (macOS/Linux)
**Solution**:
1. Try using `python` instead of `python3`
2. If that doesn't work, you may need to install Python or add it to your PATH

### Issue 3: Permission Error During Installation
**Solution**:
1. Right-click the Python installer (Windows)
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Proceed with installation

## üìö Next Steps

Now that Python is installed, you're ready to start learning! Here's what to do next:

1. **Explore Python REPL**:
   - Open Command Prompt/Terminal
   - Type `python` (Windows) or `python3` (macOS/Linux) and press Enter
   - Try simple commands like `print("Hello")` or `2 + 2`
   - Type `exit()` to quit

2. **Learn Basic Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python --version   # Windows
   python3 --version  # macOS/Linux
   
   # Run a Python script
   python script_name.py    # Windows
   python3 script_name.py   # macOS/Linux
   
   # Install packages
   pip install package_name    # Windows
   pip3 install package_name   # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Start with the Basics**:
   - Variables and data types
   - Basic operations
   - Input/output functions
