3. Search for "Python" (by Microsoft)
4. Click "Install"

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Create Your First Python Program

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Create a new file (`Cmd+N`)
3. Save it as `hello.py` (`Cmd+S`)
4. Type the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
   ```
5. Save the file (`Cmd+S`)
6. Run the program in one of these ways:
   - Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal"
   - Press `Ctrl+F5`
   - Open terminal (`Ctrl+`` `) and type: `python3 hello.py`

You should see the output in the terminal:

Welcome to Python Programming!
```

## üõ† Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Command 'python3' Not Found

**Solution**:
1. Try using `python` instead of `python3`
2. If that doesn't work, add Python to your PATH:
   - Open Terminal
   - Type `nano ~/.bash_profile` (or `nano ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)
   - Add this line: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin/python3:$PATH"`
   - Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`)
   - Restart Terminal

### Issue 2: Permission Error During Installation

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're using an account with administrator privileges
2. If prompted, enter your password correctly

## üìö Next Steps

Now that Python is installed, you're ready to start learning! Here's what to do next:

1. **Explore Python REPL**:
   - Open Terminal
   - Type `python3` and press Enter
   - Try simple commands like `print("Hello")` or `2 + 2`
   - Type `exit()` to quit

2. **Learn Basic Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python3 --version
   
   # Run a Python script
   python3 script_name.py
   
   # Install packages
   pip3 install package_name
   ```

3. **Start with the Basics**:
   - Variables and data types
   - Basic operations
   - Input/output functions
