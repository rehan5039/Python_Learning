   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
   ```
5. Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
6. Run the program in one of these ways:
   - Right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal"
   - Press `Ctrl+F5`
   - Open terminal (`Ctrl+`` `) and type: `python hello.py`

You should see the output in the terminal:

Hello, World!
Welcome to Python Programming!
```

## üõ† Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. Restart your command prompt
3. If still not working, add Python to PATH manually:

   - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add these paths:
     - `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\`
     - `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts\`
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual username and `3x` with your Python version

### Issue 2: Permission Error During Installation

**Solution**:
1. Right-click the Python installer
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Proceed with installation

## üìö Next Steps

Now that Python is installed, you're ready to start learning! Here's what to do next:

1. **Explore Python REPL**:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type `python` and press Enter
   - Try simple commands like `print("Hello")` or `2 + 2`
   - Type `exit()` to quit

2. **Learn Basic Commands**:
