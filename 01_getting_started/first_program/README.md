# üöÄ Your First Python Program

Welcome to the world of Python programming! This guide will help you write and run your very first Python program.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
- Create a Python file
- Write your first Python code
- Run a Python program
- Understand basic Python syntax

## üíª Writing Your First Program

### Step 1: Create a New Python File

1. Open your code editor (Visual Studio Code recommended)
2. Create a new file
3. Save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`)

### Step 2: Write the Code

Type the following code in your file:

```python
# This is your first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
```

### Step 3: Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each line does:

1. `# This is your first Python program` - This is a comment. Comments start with `#` and are ignored by Python. They help explain what the code does.

2. `print("Hello, World!")` - This is a function call. The `print()` function displays text to the screen. The text inside the quotes is called a string.

3. `print("Welcome to Python Programming!")` - Another print statement that displays a different message.

### Step 4: Run Your Program

You can run your Python program in several ways:

#### Method 1: Using VS Code
1. Right-click anywhere in the editor
2. Select "Run Python File in Terminal"

#### Method 2: Using Command Line/Terminal
1. Open Terminal (Command Prompt on Windows)
2. Navigate to the directory containing your Python file:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/file
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python hello.py
   # or on some systems:
   python3 hello.py
   ```

### Step 5: Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see:
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Python Programming!
```

## üîç Key Concepts

### Comments
Comments are notes in your code that are ignored by Python. They help make your code more readable:

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
Useful for detailed explanations
"""
```

### Print Function
The `print()` function is used to display output:

```python
print("Text to display")
print(42)  # Numbers don't need quotes
print("Multiple", "values", "separated", "by", "commas")
```

### Strings
Text in Python is called a string and must be enclosed in quotes:

```python
# Double quotes
print("This is a string")

# Single quotes (also valid)
print('This is also a string')

# Triple quotes for multi-line strings
print("""This is a
multi-line
string""")
```

## üß™ Practice Exercises

Try these exercises to reinforce your learning:

### Exercise 1: Personalized Greeting
Modify your program to display a personalized greeting:
```python
print("Hello, [Your Name]!")
print("Welcome to the world of Python!")
```

### Exercise 2: Multiple Lines
Create a program that prints your name, age, and favorite color on separate lines:
```python
print("Name: [Your Name]")
print("Age: [Your Age]")
print("Favorite Color: [Your Favorite Color]")
```

### Exercise 3: Fun Facts
Create a program that prints 3 interesting facts about yourself:
```python
print("Fact 1: [Your first fact]")
print("Fact 2: [Your second fact]")
print("Fact 3: [Your third fact]")
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
**Cause**: Missing closing quote
**Fix**: Make sure every opening quote has a matching closing quote
```python
# Wrong
print("Hello World)

# Correct
print("Hello World")
```

#### NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
**Cause**: Incorrect capitalization
**Fix**: Python is case-sensitive; use lowercase `print`
```python
# Wrong
Print("Hello World")

# Correct
print("Hello World")
```

#### IndentationError: unexpected indent
**Cause**: Extra spaces at the beginning of a line
**Fix**: Remove unnecessary leading spaces
```python
# Wrong
    print("Hello World")

# Correct
print("Hello World")
```

## üìö Next Steps

Congratulations on writing your first Python program! Now you're ready to learn:

1. **Variables**: Storing and manipulating data
2. **Data Types**: Working with different kinds of information
3. **Input/Output**: Getting information from users
4. **Basic Operations**: Mathematical calculations

Continue with the course to explore these concepts in depth!

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why do we use `print()`?
A: The `print()` function displays output to the screen, allowing you to see the results of your program.

### Q: Why do we need quotes around text?
A: Quotes tell Python that the content is a string (text). Without quotes, Python would try to interpret the text as code.

### Q: What does "Hello, World!" mean?
A: "Hello, World!" is a traditional first program in any programming language. It's a simple program that displays this text to verify that everything is working correctly.

### Q: Can I use single or double quotes?
A: Yes, both work the same way in Python. Choose one style and be consistent.
