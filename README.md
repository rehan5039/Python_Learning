# Lecture 1
 Hi coders and welcome to the complete Python series in which we will be covering Python language. After completing this series, if our interest is in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science field, then we will be able to learn machine learning. Or if we want to go to the web development domain later, we want to work on frameworks like Django, we want to make websites, then we will be able to learn that too. In this series, we will be reading in such a way that today it may be possible that we do not know to write even one line of code. But after completing the series, we will be able to write good programs. Plus there are many such concepts of programming which we have learned and we have applied them. Now whenever we talk about Python, for the past many years, Python has been the most loved language in the tech industry. There are many such good programmers who start their programming journey, coding journey with Python. And it is also one of the easiest language to start coding with. And that's why we will also start our coding journey with Python. To start this Python series, there are no prerequisites. That is, if we have not written any code in any other coding language then it's absolutely fine we will be starting things with zero level and gradually we will be upgrading our level in programming in our series, in our lectures we will be studying theory concepts but along with that we will be writing a lot of code to practice things to get hands on practical experience and along with that we will be solving practice questions related to every important topic and along with this you will be getting the links of all the slides and notes of the series in the description box below so let's start with the lecture 1 of our Python series in which we will cover introduction to Python in this we will cover the concept of taking input and output in Python, what are the variables, what are the data types and what are the operators we will be covering all these concepts in our lecture 1 now let's talk about what is programming? Two major components are involved in programming. One is that we have a machine. This machine can be our laptop or computer. And the second thing we have is code. And what we do is we write code and give instructions to a machine which we call a program. That is, if I have to do something from my laptop or computer, then I will give instructions to it. Now the computer does not understand Hindi, English, Nepali, Marathi, all these languages like us. So that's why we call it Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, we call it to do the work in these languages. Now we can understand it as if we went to France. If we are going to France, we will have to speak French there. If we are going to Nepal, we will have to speak Nepali there. If I am going to Maharashtra, I will have to speak Marathi. Similarly, if I want to talk to the computer, I will have to talk to the language that the computer understands. So that's why we use programming languages. In which languages we talk to the computer Now there are many programming languages Java, C++, Javascript can also be there And here the programming language we are reading We call it Python That means whatever code we write To work with computer, laptop Basically to work with our machine All, basically to work from machine all that code will be in Python but there is a small twist in this also now machine can't understand Hindi, English, Marathi computer can't understand Python directly because Python is a very easy language Java, C++, C are very easy languages which we understand as humans computers or machine understand language of 0 and 1 means machine only understands numbers how it can understand numbers in numbers only 0 and 1 in form of high voltage and low voltage means in machine if you pass high current it will understand it as 1 and in machine no current will pass it will understand it as 0 it is a basic electronics so that's why we wrote our code in python which looks like English but to explain that code to the machine we have translators in between like if I go to France and I don't know how to speak French then I will take a translator or guide with me who will translate my English or my Hindi into French the computers which understand the language of 01 the work of translator is that our python will take and translate that python in the machine language That's why we call python as a high level language So the work of translators is to directly convert high level language into low level languages or into machine level languages These can be our translator compilers or interpreters. So, there is an interpreter inside Python which translates our Python code into machine form. So, from here we have clear that whenever I have to do something from my computer or machine, I have to write the code of Python. Now let's talk about what is Python. Before understanding Python, there are some basic features about which we should know. First thing is that Python is very simple and easy to understand. Means there are so many surveys every year in which it is said that Python is one of the easiest languages to start with programming or to start with coding as a beginner. So for beginners, if you want to start coding in Python, then we feel it is like English, that's why it is simple and easy to understand. Second is that Python is free and open source. It means anyone can use Python. In general, many programming languages are free, but many programming languages are paid too. But Python is a free language, anyone can use it. You can do it, I can also use it for free. And third is that Python is a high level language. There are some changes that can't be done directly at the machine level, but it is easy to understand for humans. Now these engineers had developed Python, Guido and Rossum, first they used to work in Google, now they are engineers in my ex-company Microsoft, distinguished engineer, means they have been given a very special degree. So they had made Python, and along with this Python is a portable language. Meaning the Python code you can write in your windows, that Python code your friend can run in their Mac OS, means in Apple's computer. And the same Python code your other friend can run in their Linux system. So Python is same according to different operating systems, that code is also same and that code can run in all the different operating systems. Apart from this, by using Python, we can explore many different branches of programming. Meaning, by using Python, I can go into my data science, I can learn machine learning, I can learn AI, along with that, I can also do web development, I can make websites, so in the backend, we are using a framework of Python called Django. And we can make our games using Python, so there can be a lot of things using Python. So it is a very versatile language by which we explore different areas of programming and work on them. So let's start with our first program in Python. We talked a lot about the code in Python, Python is a versatile language, Python is an open source language, and we talked about coding and machine. But what does code actually mean? What does it mean when I say that we write code in Python? So to understand that, we are going to write our first program or first code in Python. Now before writing the code of Python, we have to download two things in our system. First of all, we have to download Python in our system and after that we have to download Visual Studio Code in our system. We definitely need Python because we want that when we write the code of Python in our system, it can recognize the code of Python, run it and execute it. And we are downloading Visual Studio Code because it is going to be a digital notebook. Till now, in school and college, all the things we have written and studied, we used to do it on notebooks. But we cannot write code with a paper pen. The correct way to write code and run it is to write it in our code editors. And Visual Studio Code is one of the best freely available editors out there. So that's why we are using VS Code. Now first of all, we will be looking at the installation of Python for Windows. After that, we will be looking at the installation of Python for Mac OS. And then finally, we will download Visual Studio Code for both Mac and Windows. Now for the installation of Python on Windows, first of all, we can go to our browser browser we can go to chrome and we can search for download python for windows We have to go to the link which will come on top of the top we have to click on it This link will be of python.org when we will go to this link then we will have a big yellow button on which download python 3.1 2.1 is coming. If we are watching this lecture later, then it is possible that we have updated the python version and there is a latest version available there. So, if we want, we can download a different version too. Then also we can follow our lecture completely. If we want, we can click on this download button. Otherwise, the downloads written above, after going there, we will get the python option. We will click on it and our Python download will start. As soon as our download is completed, we can double click on our exe file if we want. We will get a window like this in which we will click on run and our installation will start. Now before starting the installation, we have two check boxes on the top of the window which we have to check always. The first one is for admin privileges which we will tick and the second one is for python.exe which we have to tick. After ticking, we will click on our install now and our installation will start. After installation is complete, we will get setup was successful and we can simply close this window. Now next we are going to download Python for macOS. We can go to our browser inside macOS and we can search for python.org slash downloads. From here, the yellow button that will come to us to download, we will have the latest version of python coming on it. We can click here and start our python download. If you want to see the lecture later, then you may have more updated version and latest version available. So if we want we can download that latest version too. We will not have any problem in following the whole lecture. We have to download, if we want we can save our package in downloads. As soon as it is downloaded, we will double click on our package and we will get our installation window. To install, we can click on continue. After continuing, we will agree. Then we will get a window to enter our password. We will enter our password in it and we are going to install the software. And as soon as Python is installed, we can close this window. After closing the window, we can go and keep the installer or we can move it to the bin. Now if we want to verify whether Python python is installed in our system or not. So for that there is one way that we can open our terminal. And in the terminal we can type this command python3 dash dash version. As soon as we enter this, we will have the python currently installed version printed. By which it is verified that python has successfully been installed in our system. This same command will work in Mac and we can run this same command in Windows. Now next we are going to install Visual Studio Code in our system. So first of all, to download it, we will search on the internet, download vs code. So we have to go to the first link here I will tell you the site also code.visualstudio.com slash download now there are many options in this now you are on windows machine windows 7,8,10,11 so here according to your system if it is a 64 bit system then which one you have to, if it is 32 bit, then which one to download. Mostly people have a 64 bit system, so you can click here and download it. If you are on Linux, then you can download according to that or if you are on Mac, then you can download according to that. Now whenever you download for Windows, then many check boxes will come in the middle for us. What we have to do is tick all these checkboxes. As soon as we tick, our Visual Studio Code will be installed completely. And now we can open it for the first time. Now once I have installed Python and Code Editor inside the system, I am going to open my Visual Studio Code. I am working on Mac OS, so my Visual Studio Code window is looking something like this. If you are on Windows operating system or you are on Linux operating system, then also your window will look like this. Means as soon as you click on Visual Studio Code, some screen will appear for you. You will not have this recent section because I have Visual Studio Code installed for a long time. But if you have installed it new, then you will only have this start window. Now whatever things I am going to do in my macOS, you can do it on your windows also So whatever I am going to do here, the same steps we have to follow to run our python code First of all I will click on new file and then I will click on text file So what happened for me, a text file has been created Means as the file is created in our system, I cross it. Here is the file symbol, explorer. By clicking on the explorer, I will know which folder I am on. Here I can see that I have not made any folder yet. Here folder means where my file is being saved. And if you click on explorer again, then it will also be closed. What I am going to do, first of all I will save this file. To save, I press command S or control S, you will click on the explorer again then it will be closed. What I am going to do is first of all I will save this file. To save I will press command S or control S you can click. To save I am going to give the name of the file here. I will name it first program dot py. Now whatever Python files we make, at the end of them we have to write dot py. This is the name of my first program And what is.py?.py is an extension Like if I want to make a text file Then I write.txt If I want to make a java file Then I write.java If I want to make a C++ file Then I write.cpp Similarly if I want to make a python file in programming Then I will write.py at the end By doing.py you can either make a new folder Or you can save it in any folder. I am going to save it in this Python folder. So what happened here? I will see that my file name is firstprogram.py. Where is this file? It is a folder named Shraddha Kapra. It has a Python folder in it. In that, my firstprogram.py file is there. And this is my Python icon. So now I am going to write a line in this file. Now what does this line mean or what does it mean to write words? We this file Now what is the meaning of this line or what is the meaning of the words I am writing We don't have to pay much attention to that I am going to click print and then I have put double quotes And I wrote hello world So I have done this here, save the file And on the right side you will see this run button Run Python file, I will click on this As soon as I clicked, a window appeared below, In which I have this line, hello world, printed as it is, What I did is basically I wrote a Python code, That is, inside Python, on the screen, which is below, Which is my output screen, I have to print anything on it, For that, I can write this line, and whatever I have to print inside double quotes, I can write that, usually I can write whatever I want to print in double quotes. Usually when we start a new programming language, we write hello world. So writing hello world is a little custom. You will write Java's program, C++, any language, we start with hello world. Now it is not necessary that I write hello world here. I can also write my name here. So if I write my name and run my code again, then this time my name is printed for me. Now if I write my college here, then I can print this too. So I have my college output. So this is my first program in Python. Now let's understand what were the different components of the first program. In the first program we wrote print hello world. Now this print is the name of a function inside the print python. Now we don't have to go into detail about how to implement the functions. Basically I have to understand that I have given some command to it. The purpose of functions is to complete some work. So the work of this print function is to print anything on the screen You will write print and put parentheses here And will put double quotes So whatever you will write inside will be printed on our screen as it is If I want, I can write my college by cutting this whole hello world So my college will be printed on the whole screen And in the same way, you can write your name, then your name will also be printed on the screen. And this is called the output inside Python. Output means the one that is printed and written on my screen and I can see it. Now if we come to understand the fundamentals of any code, then what does any code do? Let's assume I have written any code. Here we are always going to write Python code So any code takes some input and returns some output to me Like if I understand it from a very simple example So we must have searched Google What do we do in Google search? Whatever I have to search, we type it Let's assume that I have to search news So I will type news Now here in Google search Whatever I have to search I, then I will type news. Now here in Google search, whatever I have to search, I have given input to Google search in a way and the result it will bring for me will be output. So Google search, Google must have written some code with the help of which input is taken and output is returned for it. So now what we are printing is the output of my code. Slowly we will learn that what other changes we can do in this Python code and how the input is taken in Python. Now let's talk about the character set of Python. We can use different characters in Python. Like in English I know that from A to Z and from small a to small z I have an alphabet. In Hindi I know that A, E, E in this way our letters are going, similarly python has its own character set, means you can't use extra characters other than this, means it's not like you will bring a Punjabi letter, you will try to type it, or we will bring a Marathi letter, so in this way different languages ‚Äã‚Äãletters do not work, python has a fixed character set, in python we can use English capital A to capital Z, small a to small z. Apart from that in letters we can use all digits from 0 to 9. In special symbols we have minus plus, hyphen, multiply, divide, percentage, we can use all the special characters present on our keyboard. We can also use white spaces, that means if I want to give a blank space, a tab space Then we can use them And other than that In ASCA and Unicode characters We can use all our data or literals We will not go into much detail about this The basic keys present on our keyboard And the characters and numbers we use in English All of them are valid in Python So that's why Python is called The closest language of English. And if you see the instructions in it, then all the code that we are writing, it will be very simple and easy to understand. Now, as I wrote this print statement, so it is clear by looking at the print statement, even if someone does not know how to write code, that what is the work of this? Its work is to print whatever is written in it. That's why Python is very simple and easy to understand Now moving forward we will write a little bit in python And practice how to print the output in it Let's assume that I have to print my name first So I will write print Shraddha is my name In this way I can print the sentence also In the next line I can write my age is 23 So in this way you also print your name and print your age in the next line So let's save it and now run So my screen has been printed first as Shraddha's name and then my age is 23 Now we can print these two things in the same line Means if I want to print the same output in the same line above So I will copy this part What I will do is in the first line I will give comma here and after that I am going to write the second line So this will be my first line This will be my second line But here a twist is going to happen As soon as I will save it and run it What happened this time Earlier these two things were printed on different lines But this time both the sentences were printed on the same line So when we write print statement And in that comma Both things were printed on different lines but this time both sentences are printed on same line So when we write print statement and write multiple things by separating from this comma So it is printed on same line If I want to take it to next line then I have to use different print statements Now apart from this we can print numbers in python Why numbers? If I write here simply without double quotes and I save and run it. So in this case 23 will be printed on my screen. Similarly I can print 25 or 35. Let's do it again save and run. So this time for me both 23 and 35 will be printed. And along with this I can print numbers by doing plus and minus. That is if I want to print 35 plus 23 Then I can do this save and run So in the first line I have 23 printed, as it is In the second line I will get the sum of both which is 58 So in this way different sum, multiply, divide All these operations are also allowed in Python Now I have learnt how to print basic things in Python. Now let's talk about variables in Python. Like in programming variable is a name given to a memory location in a program. Now if I talk about math here. So we used to study a lot of things in math when we were small. Let's assume I have given a rectangle. Its one length is equal to A and the other side is equal to B. Now if I want to find the area of this rectangle, then what I used to do is, I used to do A multiplied by B. If I want to find its perimeter, then I used to do 2 into A plus B. On the other side, if I have given any square, then if there is one side A in the square, then I know that I will have A on the other side as well. And its area will be A multiplied by A. Now it is possible that this a square of any size, A can be of 5, A can be of 10, A can be of 50, A can be of 100. Similarly, as the questions of math were asked, the length and breadth of the rectangle used to change. According to that, I had a fixed formula in which I could change the values. So in math, this A, this B, this A, we call them variables. Variables means the one whose value changes. Variable means in English, which means to vary. Whose value can be changed. So as we used variables in math, we can use variables in programming also. Like if I write here, name is equal to Shraddha. So what I did is, I made a variable whose name is name And I have stored the value of Shraddha in it So this is the name of my variable And this is its value We always write variable is equal to my value Like I have written age is equal to 23 So I have my age variable And its value is 23 Now it is possible that after 1 year age. Now it is possible that the age will increase after 1 year, it is possible that it will obviously increase. So tomorrow if it is 24 instead of age 23, then what can I do? I can make changes in this age variable. After 2 years it has become 24 to 26, so changes will happen in this age variable and a new value will be stored here. Like I took price, so I can store a price store 25.99 in price. So this is my value and this price will become my variable. Whenever we write variables, variables means memory location. If I imagine, then my computer's memory will look like this, like our empty plots. Now, to store variables means you picked one plot from those empty plots and make a house on it. Like in computer we can visualize our memory in this way which has a lot of empty space. Now, as soon as I make a variable, let's assume I made a variable name in which value is stored, Shraddha. So, any random memory is saved in the computer, whose name I gave and I stored my value in it what value I stored? I stored the Shraddha value so this place in the memory was reserved it was fixed that this variable was stored here so that's why when I write a name in my Python program then the Python program will know that which name I am talking about name means that the value Shraddha is stored in it. So if I want to print my name now, then I can simply print it. If I print it and write the name in this way, then what will happen? The value of Shraddha will be printed on my screen for me. So if I change this name tomorrow and do something else, then next time I will print the name, then the new value will be printed. Similarly, if I will print the name, then the new value will be printed. Similarly, if I have declared the other variables, if I have written age is equal to 23, then it means that there is a random place in memory where the name of that place is and the value of 23 is stored in it. And in the same way, if I have written price is equal to 25.99, then it means that there is a random place in memory If I have written price is equal to 25.99 So there is a random place in memory Whose name is price And the value is stored in it by going to 25.99 So this way my variables are used in memory Now it may happen that I change the value of variable Means if I make age equal to 24 So what will happen Age variable will remain there But the value inside will be 23 and will be equal to 24 So next time when we will talk about age We will talk about this new value Which is stored in the variable named age Let's write the variables in code And see how they are used in the code So I have made my Python file Nothing is written in this file What I am going to do is define some variables Means as soon as I write name equal to and then I am going to write double quotes. I have written my name in double quotes. In the next line I will write age equal to then I wrote my age. In the next line I am going to write price is equal to 25.99. So in this way I have made a name variable by doing name is equal to Shraddha. In which value value stored. Age is equal to 23 and my variable is age. Price is equal to 25.99 and my variable is price. Here I have stored a string in it. What did I say? I called it a string. What is a string? A string is when you want to write a word or sentence or mix of words in a words if we want to write in the program, then we write it in double quotes. Now if you want, we can use single quotes or triple quotes, but usually by convention we will use double quotes. So the things we write in double quotes remain the same. So here I wrote Shraddha, so Shraddha will remain the same. If I think that no, I will remove Shraddha and remove these double quotes, then it will be wrong. This will be wrong according to the syntax of Python, that is, according to the rules of Python. That's why if you want to write a string, a word, a sentence, then you have to write it in double quotes. Similarly, 23 is a normal number, an integer number. 25.99 is a floating value, that means a decimal is added to it. We could have done 26.99 here,, 26.2, 25.00 also. So in this way I have defined multiple variables in my program. Now how to print these variables? Usually when we used to print, I used to say that we will write double quotes and name. So once we have written this code, we will run it. After running, what happened? name was printed on my screen. But I don't want to print the name, I wanted to print the Shraddha. Which was stored under the variable named name. So if we write anything by writing double quotes in print, Then it will be printed as it is. Here write name, here if I save by writing age, If I print, then I will have the age printed. But I want to print the value of age. So whenever I have to print the value, I remove these double quotes. And now if I write the age and run this code, then I have my age 23 printed. Similarly, if I run this by writing the name, then I have my name Shraddha printed. Similarly, if I save the price and run it, then my price is 25.99. So whenever I have to use the value of the variable, then I simply write the name of the variable. There I am not using double quotes, single quotes, quotes because quotes are used for strings. Now what we do is we print all these variables in the form of a sentence. Means I am going to print my name is Here I have put colon And after that I will write Comma, by doing comma I want to print Shadda on the same line So I will write name In the same way I will write on the next line My age Is Colon and again by doing comma I have printed age We will skip the price for now Let's save this once and now run After running it came in output My name is colon This part and sentence It is printed as it is After that I wrote comma and name So the value in name was printed In the same way in next line My age is printed as it is And after that age 23 was printed in the form of value. So in this way we can use our variables in our Python code. Now one more thing about variables. If I write A is equal to B in math, then it means A and B are equal. But this doesn't happen in Python. If I write age is equal to 23 in Python, it means I am trying to take value from right side to left side. Means value of 23 in right side is stored in age. Similarly if I write here age is equal to 25, then value of right side is stored in left side. So this is called assignment rule. This sign of equal to We call it assignment operator Assignment means to go to value and store So age is equal to 25 means 25 value goes to value and stored in the variable named age Now in python there is one thing that I write variable Is equal to something Apart from that if I make another variable age2 So in this I can assign a value of a variable means if I write age2 is equal to age so it means whatever value is in age now it will be stored in age2 so if I print age2 here we remove this statement and in first line I will just print age2 I did this run so 25 was printed in age2 this happened because 25 was stored in age, now I assigned the value of age2, so 25 came in age2 also, so when I printed age2, then I got 25 printed on the screen, now in python the names of the variables have some rules, so let's understand once, rules for identifiers. What are identifiers? Identifiers are our names. These can be the names of our variables. Variable name means, the name I have written here is equal to Shraddha. This name is the name of my variable and it is the value of that variable. Here I have written age is equal to 23. In that age is the name of my variable and 23 is its value. So all the names of the variables we write have some rules. In the name of our variable, uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, and underscores can also come. That means in the name of the variable, I can use any letter from A to Z, any letter from capital A to Z, any digit from 0 to 9, and I can also use an underscore. But in the name of the variable, I can't use percentage name of the variable, I can't use this type of symbols at the rate. The second rule says, like its example is that I gave my variable the name of my variable, this variable gave underscore 1, variable for print, all these are valid names. Apart from this, the identifier, identifier can also be the name of my variable, if we read the function further, then it can also be the name of my function. And in other places where I have to write the name of my variable also. If we read the function further, then it can be the name of my functions also. And in other places where I have to write the names of things, like the names of variables, there we follow these rules. Second is that whatever the identifier is, that is the name of the variable, it cannot start with digits. Means you write one variable like this or write variable one. This is valid but this thing is not valid because here in starting digit came, digit can come later but can never come in starting. So, like variable 1 is valid and 1 variable is not valid. Apart from this, there are special symbols like hash, at the rate, percentage, dollar sign, exclamation mark. We can't use these kind of symbols in identifier. And identifiers can be of any length. That means if I want, I can write a big kind of symbols in the identifier and identifiers can be of any length means if I want I can write a big name of my variable I can write my variable name as this is my python variable this big name will also be of my python variable there will be no error in python but because we are good programmers and whenever we write code it is not necessary that we write the correct code, It is also necessary that our code is so beautiful to see, it is so presentable and other people can understand it easily. That's why a good programmer, a good coder is recognized that the names of their variables are simple, short and meaningful. One is simple, this name is neither simple nor short, we don't even have to keep very complex names, like I don't know, like I don't know, like I don't know, now this is a valid variable name, but this is not a simple name at all. What will be a simple name? Like I give an age name to a variable, give a name name to a variable, give a count name to a variable, give a sum name to a variable. All these are simple and all these are short too. We don't have to give long names forcefully. And they are meaningful. Now by reading this name variable itself, we understand its meaning that it has a name stored in it. By reading age, we understand its meaning. It has age stored in it. By reading sum, we understand its meaning. It has sum stored in it. By reading count, we understand that it has sum stored in it. It is understood by reading count that it has count stored in it. So that's why all our identifier or the names of the variables have to be kept meaningful, short and simple to understand. Now apart from this, there is one more special thing about variables. Like here we have used many variables in the code. Here I used name, age, price. Now I am going to show you one thing by printing Now I am going to print something. I am going to print type. I will write type and name in it. I am going to print type in the next line. I will write age in it. I am going to print type in the next line. And I will write price in it. Now I had made a name variable. I am printing its type. I am printing the type of age. I am printing its type, printing the type of age, printing the type of price. You must be thinking that what is the meaning of type in the variables? So once it is printed, then also it will be understood. Here I have printed, in the first line type of name, what is the type of name? Class str, then printing type of age, in type of age it is saying class int. Then printing type of price, in typeofage it is saying class int then it is printing typeofprice, in typeofprice it is printing class float we read it as string, s-t-r-i-n-g, we read it as string, it is stry we read it as int, we read it as float what python does is, as soon as you you have written in a variable. For example, there is a string in this name. What can be a string? It can be a string word, sentence, paragraph. Basically, whatever we write in English becomes a part of our string. So it printed the type of the name that it is a string. Python automatically detected it. You didn't have to tell it separately. You have stored 25 in age, so Python has detected that the value in it is of the type int, that is, there is an integer value. If I would have done here minus 25 also, here if I do minus 25, save it and run it again, then also int will be printed. That is, integer value can be either minus, plus or zero. And this 25.99 is printed in the type floating value. Float means which contains decimals. So Python automatically detects the type of our value. And this type is called data type. That means the type of data, whatever type of data we have stored in the variable, it will have different types and according to that, Python many data types in python. In python we read primary data types of 5 types. One is we have integers, one is string, one is float, one is boolean and one is none. So we are going to read these primary data types in python. If I talk about integer then in python integer data type is there in which our positive values come, negative values come and 0 comes. These are all whole values, means minus 5.9 will not come in it but minus 5 will come. So 25 will come, minus 25 will come and 0 will come, these are all our valid integers. And for this type we have print and int, so we call it int type. for this type we have print and then int so we call it int type second type is string type in string type we can write any sentence or word like I have written my name so this is of string type if I have written hello so this is also of string type now we can write string in single quotes means in which we use this these are our single quotes we can use this in double quotes and we can write this in triple quotes and triple quotes also. Means if I want to write a string then I can print it in three ways. For example, if I want to write name is equal to or name1 is equal to sk. So I can write like this, if I want name2 is equal to. Here I can write sk this, if I want then name 2 is equal to, here with single quotes I can write sk, and if I want then with triple quotes, I can write sk like this, now we can print these three, I will print name 1, in next line I will print name 2, and in next line I will print name name 3 in the next line let's save and run so after running I got the same values of all 3 strings means I can represent my string in any way I can do it with single code or triple code but usually we will prefer to print all the strings with double code so in this way the second data type that we have is our string data type. Apart from this, we also have float data type. Decimal values come under float data type. Like I want to write 3.99 or 2.5 or 9.0. So, all these will be my floating values. And the fourth data type is the Boolean type. There can be only two values in Boolean. One value is true and one value is false. Like in math there are true and false, the same meaning is there in Python of Boolean values. Means true and false. Like if I have written age is equal to 23 and then I am writing old is equal to false. So this means that my age variable is of integer type, int type and my old variable is of boolean type. Because I have stored false values in it. This thing always have to be taken care that whenever we are writing true or false, In that T is capital T and F is capital F. If we write it small then this value will be wrong. So we are writing boolean values with capital F and capital T. And the fifth data type we is our NONE data type NONE basically represents where we don't want to store any value so if I write NONE in any random variable A so it means that A has no value yet and there is no value stored in it once we will make a Boolean variable and a NONE variable in the code I am going to take a simple variable, age is equal to 23 and in the next line I am going to write old is equal to false and in the next line a is equal to none. Now I am going to print type of old and in the next line I will print type of A. Let's save this. Now this type is also a function but we are not talking about functions right now. That's why I am not explaining this type much that how type and this old is printing its type. We will talk about it when we will be reading the chapter of functions. So as soon as I printed type of old, what is there in old? There is boolean value. So boolean value is printed here. And if A has none, then none type is printed for it. That there is no valid value in it. Now apart from this, if I had done small f instead of false, then in that case I would have got an error. If I write small t as true, then also error will come in that case. But if I write true with capital T, then error will not come. My code will run perfectly. But if I write true with capital T then there will be no error. My code will run properly. I can run it again and this time the same values will be printed. So this way our data types work in our Python language. Now let's talk about the keywords in Python. Keywords are some reserved words in Python. Like in English we have dictionary. There are some fixed words in dictionary which have fixed meaning. Now I know that if Apple is written there are some fixed words which have fixed meaning. Now I know that if there is an apple written in the dictionary then it will have a fixed meaning. By the way, there is a small dictionary of Python which has some reserved words which have been stored. In Python we have all these reserved words. Means and is our reserved word, as, assert, break. Here we will see that true is a reserved word for us, or none is a reserved word for us, or false is a reserved word for us, means this false, this none, this true, these are all keywords, there is one more meaning of keywords that you can't make keywords as identifier, means tomorrow you can't keep your variable name as lambda, tomorrow we can't keep our variable of our variable as lambda, we can't keep the name of our variable as return or true. These words can be used for the same meaning in Python, we can't use these words in Python for any other work. Means the work of true, false or none will remain the same for which Python has reserved them. Now here we will see many keywords together, but don't worry about how we will remember all of them. As we cover all the Python parts, we will cover all these keywords one by one. Like now we don't need to remember that false, none and true because we have read all three. So we already know the meaning of them and now we also know that these are all keywords. So we don't use their names like the name of the variable. Similarly, as we read more Python, we will remember all the names of the keywords so we don't have to remember it now, we will remember it with time now we have to keep one more thing in mind that Python is a case sensitive language there are many languages that are not case sensitive there are some languages that are case sensitive what does it mean to say case sensitive that in Python capital A and small a are different like SQL is structured query language if you will study a subject named DBMS in college or school then you will know that in DBMS SQL is not case sensitive language means in that you write capital A or small a everything is equal but python is not that kind of language in python if you write capital Apple in Python and small apple, then this is a different variable and this is a different variable. Both the variables are not the same. So here capital means what is upper case and what is small, what is lower case, both are different things. So that's why whenever we write keywords in Python, we have to remember that Python is case sensitive. That's why I told that whenever we write write true, the initial letter will remain capital. When we are writing false, the initial letter will be F capital. When we are writing none, the initial letter will be N capital. Otherwise, Python will give us an error. So that's why when we are printing output for the first time, when we are using data types for the first time, we have to remember that the things that I am getting written in the code should be the same in each letter otherwise we can get errors. Now next we are going to solve a small problem. What we have to do is print sum of two numbers in Python. That is, I have to write code for this. Now if I have to assign a value in two numbers and then print their sum, then what will be the logic for that? The logic will be that first I make two numbers. Let's assume my first number is A and my second number is B. I can store the value in A equal to 2. I can store the value in B equal to 5. So this is my first line and this is my second line. That I have two variables A and B which have value 2 and 5. Now if I want to store their sum, then first I can calculate their sum. So just like calculation is done in math, same calculation is done in Python. That means I can make their sum so as in math calculation is done same way in python calculation is done means I can make one more variable sum is equal to a plus b so directly what will python do first it will take a value of 2 and then b value of 5 both will add 7 and will store value in sum 7k equal and after that if I want to print sum then I can write print sum. So this will be my full program of 4 lines in which I have 2 variables a and b and I am calculating the sum of both of them and I am printing it. So let's write this once in Python code. This is my file in which I have made one variable a is equal to 2 and the second variable I have made b is equal to 5. I am making the third variable sum is equal to 2 and the other variable b is equal to 5. I am making the third variable sum is equal to a plus b and after that I am going to print my sum in the next line. Let's save this and now run. So I have 7 printed. So what did Python do? Directly 2 plus 5 i.e. we have stored 7 in the sum and we have printed the same thing. If I had 1000 here and I had 500 in b, then in that case I would have printed the same thing. Here if I had 1000 and in B I had 500, then in that case I would have printed a different sum. This time it has been printed as 1500, means 1000 plus 500 is equal to 1500. And here if I was not asked to calculate the sum, but the difference was asked that calculate A minus B, then I could have simply written here A minus B and after that I would have run it, then it would have been printed as So I would have printed 500. Means 1000-500 is equal to 500. So instead of sum I would have given the name of this variable difference. So here basically I have printed my difference which is equal to 500. So in this way if I have to write any basic code of python, then we can define the variables in this way. In this way we can perform some work in this way and we can print our output in this way. Now next we are going to talk about comments in Python. Comments are the part of our program that never executes. For example, if we have to write something in our code to explain our code, then we will write it in the form of comments. We generally start comments with our hash. By writing hash, we can write our single comments and by using triple quotes, we can write our multi-line comments. Let's see how comments work exactly. For example, I wrote print hello world on my screen. Now I know this line is a normal part of my code which will be executed Now if I write this line by copying it twice and if I put a hash in front of the second line Then what will happen? This will become a comment Comments are highlighted by Visual Studio Code in green color And now I am getting to know that this is a part which will not be executed If we run our code by saving it Then in the output we will have hello world will be printed only once. If we want, we can write any normal English in the comments. Like hi, I am a comment. Now if we want, we can write a multi line comment in our program. Like we can write multi line comment in this way in three lines or in two lines and if we comment out this, then one way is that we use two hash and the other way is that we can use triple quotes in this way. So this becomes a multi line comment which will not affect the execution of our code at all and again we will have the hello world printed. Now in visual studio code there is a shortcut to comment on lines. For example, I have a lot of print hello world and if I want to comment out these 3 lines, I can just press command and forward slash. Command and forward slash or control and forward slash in Windows, as we press, we can comment out multiple things at once and in the same way we can uncomment multiple things at once. So this is how comments work in our code. Now in Python we are going to talk about operators. What is an operator? An operator is a symbol which is used to perform some operation. In math we have seen this thing many times A plus B In A plus B, A and B are generally called operands And we call this plus as our plus operator Operator's job is to perform any operation Here plus performs the work of plus, here minus performs the work of plus, there we have minus also, minus performs the work of subtracting the other value from one value what does multiply do? it performs the work of multiplying two numbers so we have operators which we have seen in math also and the values on which operation is performed, we call them operands so an operator is a symbol which performs operations on the operands. Now we have operators of different types. Some of these operators we must have studied in Math in our childhood and some are new in programming which we study while doing programming. First of all let's talk about our arithmetic operators. Arithmetic operators are generally used to perform mathematical operations. First of all, we will talk about our arithmetic operators. For that, we will write the heading arithmetic operators. We create a number a, by which we assign a value of 5 and take another number b is equal to 2. Now, on a and b, we will perform our most basic arithmetic operations i.e. plus, minus, multiply and divide. We will perform them. To add two numbers in Python, we can write sum is equal to a plus b. This means by calculating a plus b, we are storing it under our sum variable and we can print this value. i.e. we can print our sum. Let's save it and execute. So we will get the value value print 5 plus 2 is equal to 7. If we want we can directly print it b that means directly we can print the sum of a plus b and execute it within our print function. As we have plus, similarly we have minus, similarly we have divide and multiply. So to do minus we can write a minus b, to multiply we can write A asterisk B. So this is the star symbol which is used for multiplication. For divide we use forward slash and this is A divided by B. So we save it and execute it. So we have A plus B is equal to 7, 5 plus 2 is equal to 7, 5 minus 2 is equal to 3, 5 multiplied by 2 is equal to 10 and 5 divided by 2 is equal to 2.5. Ok, here one more interesting thing is that whenever we divide a number by another number in Python, then the answer always comes in a floating value. Even though our answer could have been integer value but it will always come in the form of floating value. That means if here we had only one value of 5 instead of 5, then 4 divided by 2, we should have got the answer 2 but we will get the answer 2.0. If we re-execute it, then we will get the value of 2.0. Now these are the normal arithmetic operators which we have already studied in our math. Apart from these we have another operator which we call our modulo operator which we generally don't study in math. This is used to find out our remainder. That is, if we write a modulo, mod as our modulo operator which we generally don't study in math this is used to find out our remainder if we write A modulo we denote modulo with percentage sign A modulo B means if we divide A and B then we want to find out the remainder of both for example we have two numbers 5 and 2 when we divide 5 with 2 then we get the value equal to 1 in the remainder. So this 1 returns our modulo. If we execute after saving, then we will get the value equal to 1 in the answer. Just like we have a modulo, we have another operator which we call our power operator, that is if we write A double star B, then it means that we are trying to calculate A to the power B. A to the power B will be here, 5 to the power 2 which is equal to 25. In our answer also we will have the value returned which is equal to 25. So these were all our arithmetic operators. The next type of operators that we are going to study, we can call them our comparison or relational operators. The work of relational operators is to compare two values. We have generally seen them in math. Now if we want to compare two numbers in math, like if we want to check whether A is equal to B, then we write single equal to for that. But in Python, to check equality, we write double equal to A B, then we write single equal to for that. But in Python, to check equality, we write double equal to. In math, we write A not equal to B in this way, but in Python, we write exclamation equal to as not equal to. In fact, whenever we see exclamation in programming, it generally happens that we are trying to say not, that is, we are trying to negate anything. So this is our equal to operator and this is our not equal to operator. For example, let's take some new values and now let's talk about our relational operators. First of all, we can take our value a is equal to 50 and b is equal to 20. If we want to check whether a is equal to b, then we can simply print is a equal to equal to b. Whenever we are writing relational operators, it means that whatever expression is trying to say whether that value is true or false. That is relational operators will always return true or false in the output which is a Boolean value. This expression says A is equal to B i.e. 50 is equal to 20. So obviously the answer to this will be false. So let's save and execute it. So we will get the answer as false. Similarly if we write here A not equal to B. So the answer to that will come equal to true. That means 50 not equal to 20 is true or false. Its answer will always come true. Let's save it and we will get value equal to true in answer. In fact, let's comment out the part above once. Just like we have equal to and not equal to, similarly we have greater than, less than, greater than equal to and not equal to, similarly we have greater than, less than, greater than equal to and less than equal to. Just like here if we want to write whether A is greater than or equal to B, in that case we know that 50 is greater than or equal to 20, so in this case we will get print true. Or in fact if we want to print whether A is greater than or equal to B, this case also we will have value printed as true so let's execute, we have value printed as true and untrue just like we have done greater than, similarly we can do less than also so here A less than or equal to B and A less than B in this case we will have answer as false and in this case also we will have answer as false so let's save and execute. At last we will have two false prints. Now the relational operators we don't need to remember them as such. We can just put an eye on it. Relational operators will have conditional statements later. It is a very important topic which when we will read it we will use it many times and we will remember it by ourselves. After relational operators the next type of operators which we are going to study are our assignment operators. And we have already studied one assignment operator. Whenever we write a is equal to something, that is, if we write a is equal to 50, then we call this equal to our assignment operator. This is our equal to assignment operator. The work of assignment operators is to assign a value. So when we are writing A equal to 50, it means that we are assigning this 50 value to this variable A. This is our assignment operator but apart from this we also have many assignment operators. For example, we have a number num. We are initializing num with 10. If we want to add 10 to our number, then we a number num. We are initializing num with 10. If we want to add 10 to the number we have, then we will have a value of number plus 10. What will be number plus 10? 10 plus 10, which is going to be equal to 20. So, we will have 20 in the value of this num variable and we can print this 20 if we want. Let's save it and execute it. So, we will have a and if we want to print this 20 then we can also print it. So we will save it and execute it and we will get the value of 20. Here we can write the value of num.save and this num is going to be equal to 20. Let's do the above values, comment out. So here the statement 10 num is equal to num plus 10. This is the way to write it in short. num plus equal to 10. That means we have a special assignment operator in python which works to add any new value in that number. This statement and this statement both have the same meaning. So if we remove this statement from here, then also we will have 20 returns in output. So we have plus equal to operator which works to add a new value in that number. As we have plus equal to, similarly we have minus equal to also. So this means that value of num will return to us equal to 0. 10 minus 10 execute and answer will be 0. Similarly, we have multiply equal to multiply equal to will multiply 10 with 10 value. If we write 5 here, then it will multiply 10 with 5. In answer, we will get 50. Save and execute and answer will be 50. Similarly, we have divide equal to. When we divide 10 with 5 answer we get 50. And similarly we have divide equal to. When we divide 10 by 5, in answer we get 2. So the answer is going to be 2. Similarly we can calculate modulo also. That is our remainder. When we divide 10 by 5, in remainder we get 0 value. In answer num will be equal to 0. And similarly we have power operator. What will power do? 10 to the power 5, 10 to the power 5 will be equal to 1 lakh. So in answer we are going to get the same value. Save, refresh so we have 1 lakh. So in this way we use different assignment operators. Now as we have assignment operators, next type of operator which we will discuss is our assignment operators. Now, as we have assignment operators, the next type of operator we will discuss are our logical operators. Logical operators work on Boolean values. We have 3 logical operators in Python NOT, AND and OR. All three are very simple and in fact, their meaning is also very simple. Let's start with not operator. If we take any boolean value, then not operator returns us its opposite. If we write true in Python, then if we write not operator in front of it, then we will get value return equal to false and vice versa. Like this part we will comment out and next we will discuss our logical operators. In logical operators if we want to print not of false then we will have true return and if we want to print not of true then we will have false return. So we will execute it. So what is not of false? Not of false is true. And what is not of true? Not of true is false. Means whatever boolean value we had written, opposite of that. In fact, we can use any expression here. For example, we have a value of 50 equal to and b value is equal to 30. So if I want to write a greater than b, then what will be that value? 50 greater than 30 means true value. So here if we write a greater than b, then what will be that value? 50 greater than 30, that means true value. So here if we write a greater than b and add it in a parenthesis, then a greater than b will be true and the not of this will be false equal. Let's re-execute this. We had true value, next we got false value. That means the expression, single expression is returning returning boolean value, opposite answer of that is not returned. Just like we have not, we have next operator which we call and operator. And operator works on two values. Let's suppose we have two values, value 1 is equal to true and value 2 is equal to true. So we can print the answer of our AND operator in which we will write value 1 and value 2. So our NOT operator works on single operator whereas AND and OR operator work on our two values. Basically, to say value 1 and value 2 means that we are trying to evaluate value 1 and the value 2 in Hindi. AND operator gives true answer only when both the values are true. AND operator says that I will say true only when value 1 and value 2 are both true. So, we save it and execute it. So instead of answer operator, we have the answer of and operator. We got the answer as true or equal. So now value 1 and value 2 are both true. But if we had false here, then in that case, the answer would have been returned as false or equal. So whenever we use and operator, its answer comes true when both values are true. Just like we have AND operator, we have OR operator. OR operator means in Hindi, Ya. That means one value or another value. If any of the two is true, then I will say true. Let's write OR operator here. This is our OR operator and this is our AND operator AND operator is giving us false and OR operator is giving us true OR operator if one of the two values is true then true returns but if both the values are false then it will return false and here also if we write false then we will get return value equal to false so in this way our AND, OR and NOT, all three logical operators work. If we want, we can directly evaluate logical operators on the expressions also. For example, in our expression, we can write the expression for A is equal to 50 and B is equal to 30. Is A equal to B? So obviously this expression will return us false. And in the second expression we can check, is A greater than B? So A greater than B will give us the truth. So in this case our overall answer will be true. I hope we are able to understand that A equal to B will give us false because false because 50 is not equal to 30 but it is greater than 50. So this expression will give us true. So the answer of false and true is finally true because if any value of both is true then it returns true. If we execute then we will get the value of true equal in the answer. So in this way we can combine multiple operators and create a little logic. Here we have combined logical operator but we have also used equal to which is our comparison operator. So, these are our majority 4 operators. Apart from this we also have many operators but most frequently in Python these are the 4 operators which we are using. Now, next we are going to talk about type conversion. Type conversion is when we are converting one type of variable into another type of variable. That means if the type of my variable is integer but if I want to convert this integer into floating value then for that we use type conversion. We have 2 types of conversions in Python. One conversion is called type conversion. And another conversion is called type casting. Both have some differences. Python's interpreter automatically does type conversion for us. That means we don't have to tell it separately that convert this type to this type. Python will automatically do type conversion for us. And what is casting? Casting is forced, that means the type we convert manually. So whenever casting is happening, we have to manually tell Python as a programmer that we want to convert this type 1 variable into type 2 variable. We are going to read both of them now, so there is no need to get confused by this name. First of all, we read type conversion which is automatic conversion. For example, let's come here. For type conversion, for example, we have a variable 2 and another variable is 4.25. Now if I want to print the sum of both, then here we can make a variable sum is equal to a plus b. Now I know that one of these variables is a, its type is integer int and b's type is float. But what will python do when we are adding an int value from a float value, doing anything in any expression, performing any arithmetic operation, then Python will automatically convert this integer into a float. Because float is superior to integer, more data can be stored in float, decimal values are there in float, point something shows extra information. One is 2, one is 2.153. So this is extra information. So this is a more superior value. We generally call float as superior as compared to int. So here, Python will convert int into superior value. So when expression will be evaluated, it will mean that here it is being calculated 2.0 plus 4.25 and its answer is going to be 6.25. So when we print this sum, Python automatically will have done type conversion for us, which is implicit conversion. If we execute it, then we will get 6.25 in the answer. There is no error. But here in this expression, this A, we could have stored a string inside it. Now we know 2, in this string there is a number 2, but what is this? How will Python interpret this? This type is of type string. Here if I try to print type of variable A, this is going to be of type string and string is not allowed to be added to floating value. So when we are writing a plus b, then we will get an error. What will be the error? Python will give us an error, that is, it is trying to say by giving an error in this thing that it can only concatenate string, not float to string. That is, it is saying that you can add string to string. We are trying to add string to float which is wrong as python is saying. This is not possible. So python did not do type conversion for us in this case. But we could have converted this string into an integer forcefully. And we call that manual conversion type casting. Now how do we do type casting? to do type casting we use some functions in python like if we want to type cast any value in int then we will write int parenthesis and then we will pass our value in it so whatever value is there it will convert in integer similarly if we want to convert any value into float, then we will write our value as float and pass it in it. So whatever the output answer will be, we will have a floating value. So here to typecast the string, we can write int and this 2 will be typecast into integer value. Let's save it and now we will not get any error. Now if we print one thing which will be typeofA. If we print typeofA then this time we will get int printed. Let's save it. And this is going to be int and 6.25. If we wanted we could have done float here also. So what would have happened? It would have converted to floating value. If we run it again, this time its class is float equal and 6.25 we have got the same answer. So whenever this type of value is there, we can type cast it and convert it to a correct value. Obviously if we write our name here and try to convert it to float by type casting then it will not be possible in this case we will get an error because Shraddha or any string with characters cannot be converted into floating value type casting works only when there is data in another type which fits in our new type when there is a valid number here then then only type casting will work. In other cases, type casting will not work. So we frequently use type casting in Python to convert from one data type to second data type. If we want, we can type cast in string also. If we have a value a is equal to or let's take a number 3.14. Now if I want to convert this into a string, then we can write a is equal to string str of a and now we can print type of a. Let's save it, run it and now we will have a type of a, string equal. Now this is not a number, we have an explicit string, which we have printed. So till now we have learnt in python, how variables and data types work, how operators work, how we can print output. So the next thing we are going to cover is, we have input in python. That is how we can take input from the user. The basic meaning of taking input from the user is that if we have written any program, for example, there is a variable in that program whose value we do not have already, its value will come to us when that program is executing, that is, it will be running. And according to that, we will be doing all our calculations, so how to take that input? To take input in python, we use our input statement which is used to accept values from the keyboard using the keyboard from the user. For example to take input we can write input and we write input in the same way as we write our print statement and we can also print something in input input like we can write here enter your name and in this way we save it and when we execute this code then we will get the same statement printed on the screen that is we will get the same statement printed enter your name but after that our execution will not end means our program is still running and if we want then there is a new value which we can write here on our terminal window I am going to write my name here Shraddha Khapra, for example I wrote this name here and as soon as I press enter, my program will end How did the program end, how did I know, when I will have my folder name printed again, that is this value I have passed as an input to my program. Now if we want then this value which I have passed by writing above the terminal we can store it in any variable. Like we can create a name name variable and later we can print the value of this name also. For example I write you or here we can write welcome and then our name. Let's save it and re-execute. After rerunning what we have to do now is enter your name. So here I am going to enter Shraddha. As soon as I enter it has been printed to me welcome Shraddha. How did this come printed? I will enter this, I have printed welcome Shraddha, how it has been printed, from the input, I have given any value as input, so what will python do, it will store it in the variable name, after that when we print welcome name, then our name will be printed, if we want we can pass any number, if we want we can pass any other value, like here we can write enter your age, something like this and let's save it and here you entered, save and re execute, here we can enter age, let's suppose I write 45, entered so we got you entered 45, so the same value will be reverted back and echoed back to us. Now one special thing, whenever we use the input statement in Python, our result of the input statement is always a string. That means here, let's suppose, we want to enter some value and then what we will do is we will print the type of that value, here I am going to print type of value and then we are going to print our value, we will save it and let's refresh or in fact let's rerun, so in the beginning we will print a value value let's suppose we write our college so it entered and printed our college is a string and it printed that string now next time we will execute that code and this time we are going to enter some integer value I entered 25 but 25 is also a value its type is is string type. In fact, if we enter a decimal value here, 99.99, then also we will get its type as string. Because whenever input gets any value entered, then even if it is a number, instead of taking it as a number, what does input do? It converts it into a string. So integer will be converted in this way, if we talk about floating value, then floating value will be converted in this way, if we talk about floating value then floating value will be converted in this way, so all the things will be converted in string, so that's why if we want to take an integer value as input, if we want to take an input of floating value or any other value, then to convert it in their appropriate data type, we have to use type casting, that is whatever value is coming to us from this input, if we are expecting that value to be an integer value, then we will surround the input with this integer, that is, as we normally write, for example, as we can write int of 5, similarly now instead of this, what we have to write is, we have to write the complete input and enter some value. So whatever value we get, now we will typecast it in an integer value. This time if we run our code by saving, then we can enter the value 25, so this time we got the type of 25 as integer. The way we did int, we can do float, save and rerun. So this time if we enter 25 then we will get the value float and it will be printed 25.0. So in this way we can take any value in python as input. For example here let's suppose we want to take our name, age and our marks take input of our marks so first of all we make a variable named so inside this we can take input of our name enter name like this after that we can enter our age input enter age then we can enter our marks input enter marks and then we can print, let's suppose we write welcome and then our name, not Shrad we can print our marks. Let's do this save and execute. We can enter our name in name, we can enter our age in age and we can enter our marks in marks. So now we have this 24 and 94.4, these are string values but we can convert them to integer at the time of input and we can convert marks to floating values. Save and re-execute as such no change will come but in this way we are generally writing our proper programs in which in the beginning we are inputting some value in the beginning then we may be performing some operations on that value and then finally we print some output in our program. So all the basics of python that is the introduction of python or any language in which our input output comes, variables come, data types come, basic operations come, all those things we have covered in our chapter 1. And now finally we are going to move towards solving some practice questions. Now this is our first practice question. Whenever we are solving practice questions, first of all we have to try to see the question, understand it, you can read the question with me. After that, we have to pause the lecture and try to solve the question ourselves. If the question is solved by us, then we can come and tally our answer with our solution and if it is not solved then no problem we have to try to solve the question by ourselves and then we can come and see our explanation first question is write a program to input two numbers and print their sum means first of all we will input two numbers and print their sum. First of all we will input two numbers so from the input statement we are going to input first our first number and after that our second number. And then finally we have to print their sum. That is our first number, we will add our second number to it. This is different from our earlier question in that this time we have to input our numbers rather than defining two variables. that this time we have to input our numbers rather than defining two variables. First of all we have to input our first number. So here we write enter first. Or in fact we write enter first. And we make our variable with first name in which our value will be stored. Similarly we write second. So here we write second, so we will enter second here. And while taking input, what will be these values? They will be string, so we have to convert them into int. Let's convert it to int and we will convert it to some integer value. To print their sum, we will write print sum equal to first plus second. Let's save and run, so first of all we have to enter first, in first we enter number 20, in second we enter number 50 and answer will be we have sum is equal to 70, so in this way our small program is done which we have built, generally we have first and second, as it is possible that you may not want to give big variable names, then we can also call them a and b, x and y. Next let's come to the practice question. Next question is, write a program to input side of a square and print its area. That means if we have any square, then we know that all the sides of the square are equal. So what we have to do is, we will take the side as input and the area of the square is side multiplied by side equal. We have to print this area. We can take the side as integer or floating value. Let's take it as a floating value. To write our code, we can call our variable side and enter square side. We convert it, type cast it to float and then if we want to print the area then we can print area equal to side multiplied by side which is side square let's save it and let's run it first of all we have to enter our side so let's suppose our square side is equal to 4 so square of 4 will be 16 printed so the area of the square is equal to 4, then square of 4 will be 16 printed, so the area of the square is equal to 16. If we wanted we could have done double asterisk, i.e. side to the power 2, so that too would return the same output. Let's execute, if the side of square becomes 10 this time, then the area of square will be equal to 100. We have got 100. Next question, we are asked to write a program to input two floating point numbers and print their average. Means we have to take two float numbers, one can be floating number A and one can be number B. What will be the average of both? The average of any two numbers is A plus B divided by 2K equal. So we have to print this average value. So to print this, will write here enter first so we will get our first number let's call it A and we have already type cast it to floating value and second number will come to us let's call it B and then the average of both the numbers that is going to be a plus b divided by 2. This will be our average. Let's run this. Let's take the first number as 16.5 and let's take the second number as 3.5. 16.5 plus 3.5, both the summation will be equal to 20, 20 divided by 2 will be 10. So the average of both the numbers will be 10. As soon as we print the average, we will get the value 10.0. So in this way we have completed our code. Next program which we will write is, Write a program to input two integer numbers a and b. Print true if a is greater than or equal to b. That means if a is greater than or equal to b, then in that case we should have true print and if not then we should have false print. So simply we can do is we can input two integer numbers and our expression a greater than or equal to b, we will simply print it in our print statement. So if this expression is true then we will have true print, if expression is not true then we will have false print. So first of all let's take our two numbers as input and type cast them to integer values and in our expression we simply to simply print a greater than equal to b, save it and execute it, our first number is let's suppose 15 second number is 2, now we know 15 is greater than equal to 2 so in that case we have true, but if we take opposite first number is 2, a is equal to 2 and b is equal to 15, in that case we got true and if we take opposite that is first number we take 2, a is equal to 2 and b is equal to 15 in that case we got false return. So in this way we have covered our practice questions and I hope that our lecture 1 in python would have taught us a lot of things about the basics of python. So here our chapter 1 finish up, the slides of chapter you will get in the description box below You can download them By hope in today's lecture we have learnt a lot about python And definitely in upcoming lectures we will learn a lot about python So that's all for today See you in the next lecture Till then keep learning and keep exploring.

 # Lecture 2
  Hi everyone and welcome to the complete Python language series in which today we are going to read our chapter 2 In chapter 2 we will cover what are the strings in Python and how do strings work and some related functions and also we will cover one more important concept which are conditional statements which form the core So let's start with our chapter 2. Hi everyone, so let's start with chapter 2. In which we are going to read about strings first. Now strings is a data type, we have already read this in our first lecture and it stores a sequence of characters. That is, we store a sequence of different characters in the form of a string. It can be a single character, it can be a word, it can be a complete sentence or a paragraph. We saw three ways to create a paragraph. To create a string, we have seen three ways. For example, here in this code, we have already made a file in our folder with the name lecture underscore 2 dot py. So in this python file, we will be writing our lecture 2 codes. If I want to create a string in it, then in this way we can make a variable named string 1. In double quotes, we define our string, this is a string. So what is this string? This is a sentence which we have stored in the form of a string. We can create strings in this way also. In fact we can create strings in single quotes also. If we want we can make a string two in which we can store a single word enclosed within single quotes. the same thing we can do in triple quotes also. We can have a string 3 which we can store in triple quotes this is a string in this way. Now these three are the valid ways to create a string in python but when we are creating our string most of the time we will use double quotes because generally when we see other people's code in Python, then double quotes are used in it or in fact in other programming languages too. Here we may have a question in our mind that why do we need three different types of quotes to create strings? It is generally due to the fact for example we have to use apostrophe somewhere. That means we have to use single quote in our string. So how do we use it? For example, we have to write this is Apna College's Tutorial. Now if we enclose this string in single quotes, then Python will get confused. How will it get confused? Because single quote means the string is starting from here. And as soon as we see the other single quote, it means the string is ended here. So, this word which is left and a single single quote is left, our Python interpreter will not understand its sense. So, instead, the string in which we want to use single apostrophe, we will enclose it in double quotes, so this way a valid string will be made and we have enclosed the apostrophe, that is the single quote in it. But here if we had double quotes, then what we would have done is we would have enclosed this string in single quotes. So, in this way we have different different quotes available, different ways available so that we can use single quotes and double quotes inside the string value itself. Okay, these are very basic things, now let's talk about some other things. For example, we have to write 2-3 sentences inside a string. Like, this is a string, we are creating it in Python. We want to write 2 sentences like this. But we want that as soon as we print one sentence, our second sentence should be printed in the next line. But in this way, if we try to give the next line in our code editor, then we get an error. Because this next line is not valid in Python. So as such, generally the way we work in word documents, we cannot work in code. If we have to give the next line in in any string then for that we use escape sequence characters. What are these escape sequence characters? Let me also write it down. Escape sequence characters are some special characters whose work is to give formatting. Formatting means if let's suppose we want space of tab or we want next line then we can't directly code things like this. So to do those things we use these characters. Now if we want to print this string normally, let me try to print my string 1, so on our screen our string 1 will be printed like this and I want next line to come here. So for that what we can do that we can write backslash n backslash n is an escape sequence character which means next line whenever a string is printed or there is an operation with it then we should have the next line so we save it and run it so what will happen is that a next line will come here this extra space was created in the starting because we had extra space before v, we can rerun it and in this way we can bring the next line inside our string. As we brought the next line, we could have brought the space of tab also. If we write backslash t here, it means this is the tab escape sequence character. Let's save it and rerun. So in this way, a space of tab came between our two sentences. So we can use escape sequence characters at different times whenever we are writing a paragraph or a big line in strings. Now let's talk about how we can perform different operations on strings. The first operation we will talk about is concatenation. Now concatenation sounds like a very difficult word but it is actually a very easy thing. Like in math we can add two numbers, we can simply write a plus b. Similarly in python we can add two strings. Like if we add one string 1 and one string 2, then their output will be a valid output in python and the operation of adding two strings is called concatenation. And to add two strings in python and to connect those strings operation is called concatenation and to connect those strings we can use our plus operator in python. Like here if I create my string 1 let's call it apna and my string 2 let's call it college so we can simply write string 1 plus string 2. If we save it and run it, so we will get the output of both the strings concatenated version, means the connected version, if we want we can store the connected version in a different string also, let's call it final string, and we will store our final string here, save and run, so we have our final string, next the operation we can perform is of length, if we want we can find out the length of any string using this length function, now we don't need to take tension about functions at all, we will read functions in detail later, so now it may be that we may hear the function word again and again, so we have to imagine the function as a magical word, which we write, then a particular operation is performed for us, like as we write plus, then it adds two things, similarly, there are different functions in Python, which are inbuilt, which are used to perform different tasks. In Python, we have a length function which is used to calculate the length of a string. So we can simply write len as we write print and then our parenthesis and in that whatever string we pass, whatever string we write, we will get its length. For example, here I want to print the length of string 1. So we can simply print len of str1. Or we can store it in a different variable. Here we have made a variable named len1 and we are storing length of string 1. And then we are printing len1. Similarly, we can the length1. Similarly, we can print the length2 as well. Let's create another variable length2, in which the length of string 2 will be there. and let's print this as well. Let's run it. So first of all, we have 4 printed because there are 4 characters in our string. And after that we have 7 printed because there are 7 characters in the college. When we are creating our final string so let's suppose we create our final string in such a way that we add a space and additional in between so in this way adding a new string i.e. empty string is also completely valid i.e. first our string will come then a space will come then college will come in this way in the final string we will have an extra space in between and then if we want we space in the middle of the final string and then we can print the length of the final string. We can print length of our final string. Let's save it and run it. So we have our college printed with a space and total characters printed 12 characters. The two of the initial college and College, were 11 characters. So basically whenever a string's length is calculated, then this empty space is also counted. So never ignore spaces while counting length, we have to remember this. Because many times as a beginner we make this mistake that we think only characters will be counted in length. Spaces are also counted in length, special characters like percentage, dollar sign, add rate, in fact digits are also counted. Now in Python, another interesting thing related to strings is called indexing. Indexing is something that we get to see in different languages in programming. If you have read C language, C++, Java, JavaScript other language of this type, then I am sure you already know about indexing, otherwise we learn in Python. Basically, indexing means that whenever a string is created in Python, then internally all the characters of that string get an index. Index is kind of saying that character gets its position number. Like we used to stand in the assembly of the school, first student used to stand, then second student used to stand, then third student used to stand. Similarly whenever our string is created, we can imagine that from here, from the first character, our numbering starts, our count starts, we get to know our position. And in Python, the numbering of strings always starts with 0 instead of 1. So the first character gets index 0, second character gets index 1, third character gets index 2 and so on. And even if there are spaces or there is an underscore or a special character, it also gets index. Now how does index help us? Index helps us to access characters. Access characters means if we want to get the character of position 2, then we can directly access it. How? We can write the name of our string, then we put square brackets. In square brackets, we can write the index of which we need the character. For example, we need the character of index 2, then we can simply the index in which we want the character. For example we want the index 2 character, so we can simply write this and access our character. Let's check this thing once. In our code, let's create a string, let's call it our college, in which we have given a space. Now if I want to access the index 0 character in this, So we can call this character or ch is equal to str of 0. This means that we are accessing the 0th index character in the string and if we want we can print it also, we save it, run it and we have A printed. In the same way if we do 1 then we will have P printed, if we do 2 then we will have N printed, if we do 2 then we will get N printed, something like this, if we want we can directly access it, we can directly write string of let's suppose 3, so 0, 1, 2, 3, we should get A printed, like this, if we go to 4 we can also get our space printed, so this time the output we will get will be an empty space, so this time the output we will get will be an empty space. So in this way we have accessed the characters in the form of index, but we cannot change our characters with the help of index. That means if we want that my string of 4, this empty space, this empty space to be replaced with a dash or with an at the rate sign, then that thing will not be possible to do. If we write some code of this type and try to run it once then we will get an error. What is the error? String object does not support item assignment. Assignment means that the particular index on which we are trying to assign a different character value this is not allowed in Python. So in the form of index, we can only access characters, we cannot manipulate them, that means we cannot modify them. So this was all about indexing. There is one more special thing related to strings, which if you want to learn machine learning after learning Python, then there is a concept called slicing in Python, which we are using a lot. Because while applying machine learning algorithms we have to deal with data a lot and we have to find out relevant information from data. So, at that time we will use slicing a lot. So, that's why slicing is an important topic whenever we are reading python. What does slicing mean inside python? Slicing means accessing parts of a string. For example, if we have a fruit like apple, we cut it and call it slicing an apple. Similarly, to break strings in parts, we call it slicing. Now we can directly cut strings in Python. We can simply write the name of our string and then in square brackets we pass two indexes. One is our starting index and one is our ending index. If we have this string in which we have passed any starting index or any ending index, then the entire slice of the middle of it will be returned to us. So for slicing we write starting index colon ending index and in this our starting index is always included but our ending index is not included. For example if we have made a string in our college and if we want to access any part in it then if we have written 1 colon 4 then it will mean from index 1 to index 2, 3. All the string parts till index 3 will return back to back. So we have PNA, this string part will be returned back. Let's check this. Let's suppose I have this string and from here we try to take index from 1 to 4 save and run so we will get PNA, how did we get PNA? A is our index number 0 so we want to start from 1 so we will start from P 2 will get N and 3 will get A and we will stop at 3 because we never include 4 similarly we need one more space so we will do 5 so this time we will get PNA with an additional space. If we want, we can start this count from 0. If we do from 0 to 4, then we will get the first word, save it, refresh it, we got our and if we only want college, then what will we have to do for that, which index will we start from? 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. We will start from the 5th index for college, from index no. 5 and which index we have to go to, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, so we will write our 12, for 11th index we have to do count plus 1, so we will have the whole college printed. Ok, instead of 12 we could have written one more thing here which would be length of string. This would have been completely valid too because what is going to happen in the last thing? The last index will have plus 1, the length of our string. So we could have written length of string also, even then what would we have? The same output would have been returned. So whenever we have to give the last index, we have to go to the last index, then we can simply write length of string also. One more thing about slicing is that whenever we miss our second ending index, we have to go to the last index, then simply we can also write length of string. One more thing about slicing that whenever we miss our second ending index, then python automatically understands that we want to go to the last index. That means even if we run our program by writing only this much, then also we can reach the college. That means if we ever have to go to the last index, then we can completely skip the last index from here. And let's suppose if we write any index here and miss the starting one, then Python will automatically understand that 0 should have been here. So writing this line means that we want to go from 0 to 4. Similarly, if we write here, it means that we want to go from 5 to length of string. So sometimes in Python, if we find the starting index missing or ending index missing, then Python automatically fills it. Let's save it and try to run it. So in the first case, we have our print which goes from 0 to 4. In the second case, we have the college print is going from 5 to length of the string. Now generally in normal cases slicing works like this only. But there is one more special case of slicing in which we have negative index. Now what is the concept of negative index? In Python when we go from start to end, we increase the count of our positive index. For example, we have this string called apple, in this the initial index will be 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. But in Python there is one more special feature which is not seen in other languages. If you are coming from C++, Java background or JavaScript, then generally we will not see this in programming. That we can count our index backward also. How backward counting works? Backward counting starts with minus 1 and then we go by decreasing our number with minus 1. That means last index is called minus 1, second last is called minus 2, third last is called minus 3 and so on. So in this way if we try to slice like this, string of, it means that we are trying to go from this index to this index. And in this also our ending index will not be included. Meaning if we are trying to go from, then we will only get P and L printed. We can test this also and when we create apple then we can try to print string of minus 3 to minus 1. Let's save this and let's run it. So we will get print p and l. Similarly if we want to print from starting then we can write minus 5 from minus 5. If we want to print only this much then we will write minus 2 minus 2, save, rerun, then we will get the app printed. Meaning to go from minus 5 to minus 2 means we will cover these three characters and we will skip the last one. So, backwards counting also helps us in some cases when we do not have the exact idea of the length of the string and when we want to count our characters from the last. Although now because we are in the beginner stage, so we will not be seeing its practical cases as such. We just have to remember that this is how the concept works. Now when we are studying strings, then we are studying a lot of concepts together. Now we will study a few more functions in strings which are very useful. But as a professional programmer, sometimes we have to work with different languages together or we have many different concepts which we use together whenever we are coding in the company. So it is not necessary that all these functions are remembered together or we will remember them lifelong if we read them once. As a programmer, when you start coding in multiple languages, start learning multiple technologies, which generally all of us would be doing, whatever software engineering, machine learning, data science field, so at that time, it is not necessary that we remember all these functions. So as a programmer, many times it will happen with us that we will not remember the names of small functions, so in such cases, if we simply want to google things, then that is also completely normal. That is, if we are writing a big code in Python and if we simply want to google things, then that is also completely normal. If we are writing a big code in Python and we forget what specific function works in Python or how the slicing of negative indexing works, then we can simply google it while doing our work. A lot of practical coding is not about memorizing things, it is about understanding things from a logical point of view. it is not about memorizing things, it is about understanding things from a logical point of view. We should understand the background of how things are working logically, we don't necessarily have to memorize things, we don't have to do their work, but yes, there will be some basic syntaxes that we have to remember along with it. And it would be better than remembering that we practice things, that is, you will be writing code along with the tutorial, with the class, so we will automatically remember maximum things. That means you will be writing code with tutorial and class. So things are maximum things. You will automatically remember them. Now in next strings we will talk about functions. As we saw our length function in string, similarly we have many more functions. The first function which we will be studying is ends with function. If we write any string and write.ends with and if we pass any value in parentheses, then this function will check if our string ends with this string. This is called sub string, sub string means any small string. This function checks for us if the last part of our string is ending with this sub string. If it is ending, then we will get a return true and if it is not ending then we will get the return false. For example, let's take a string, string is equal to I am studying python from my college, in this way if we write any string, now if we want to print str.endsWith, so here we can print string.endsWith, sometimes for our help visual studio code automatically suggest us some functions which we can use, as soon as we want to use this suggestion we can simply press enter and then we will put our parenthesis whenever we write any function to use it later we have to put parenthesis always. We will read about other functions in detail later. Here if I want to check that my string is EGE, does it end with this or not, then for that we can pass EGE, we save it and run it, then we will get print true. But if I have to check that does it end with APP, then obviously my string does not have APP in the last, if we execute it then we will get false. So in this way any word, any string ends with any particular substring, for that we can check using this function. Second function which we can use which may be handy later, this is capitalized function. Capitalizing means that we can check using this function. Second function which we can use which can be handy later is capitalized function. Capitalize means to capitalize the first character of our string. For example if I make it small i and here we write string.capitalize. Only this much, so what will this function do? Whenever it prints our new string, then i will be capitalized. One more thing, if we want to print our string for the second time, like this, then our capitalized works only once, it doesn't change in the second time, i doesn't change in the original string. Whenever string.capitalize is working, it is creating a new string which will have changes. There will be no changes in the old string. But we want that there are changes in our old string too. So for that we can simply write string.capitalize is equal to string. That means we are storing this storing it in our old variable. So this time when we print our string, changes will happen in it. Now we are trying to modify our original string. As soon as we print, now modifications have been made in the original string. So whenever any function is working in the string in this way, it does not make changes in the original string, it makes a new string and changes in it. The next function that we can use is the replace function. The work of replace function is to replace an old value with a new value. For example, we have a string, I am studying Python from my college. All the o's in this string i.e. from, college, python we want to replace all these o's with a. So for that we can simply write string.replace we will first pass old value i.e. I have to replace o with a. So from this string wherever o will come it will be replaced with a. Let's try to run it. I am studying, in python instead of o it is a, in from instead of o it is a and in our college instead of o it is a. If we want we can replace the whole substring also. For example if we want to do javascript instead of python then we can write python our old value and javascript our new value, save and run and we have come to I am studying javascript from my college. Next let's talk about our find function, find function works to search for this word in our string, find function search whether this word exists in our string or not and if this word exists then wherever it exists first time, its starting index returns to us. That means whatever is the first occurrence, its first index returns to us. For example, we want to search for O in our string. So where does O come first in the string? O comes first time in Python here. So its index after returning. Let's try to do it. str.find We are trying to search for character O. Let's save it. And search. So we got the character index which is equal to 18. You can also count it if you want. But I'm pretty sure that Python program is returning us the right thing. If we want, we can search the whole world also. Like here if I write I am from studying python from then we can search for from and wherever from exists for the first time that is on our index number 5, its index has been returned to us. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 means our word starts with the 5th index. If we are searching for something which doesn't exist like for example I search for the letter Q then in that case we will get return of minus 1. Minus 1 is getting return because minus 1 as such is not a valid index. Whenever we talk about indexes we should never think about negative indexes in first thought. Negative indexes exist only for slicing. When we deal with normal strings, indexes start from zero and keep on increasing positively. Next, let's talk about another function. This is our count function. Count function counts occurrences for a substring and a string. That means if we pass any word, then how many times does the word exist in our string, its count comes to us as a return. Like in this string if we write string.count and pass from, then how many times from exists in my string, it exists twice, once here, once here, so we will get 2 printed, so we have 2. If we want to count how many times letter O exists, so it exists 4 times, where? Once in from, once in python, once in from and once in our college. So in this way we have different functions in python which we can use. In fact there are many more functions apart from this. Like if I write string dot, so all these functions that Visual Studio Code is suggesting to me, all these are valid functions for string in Python. Which we can explore if we want to. Rest, there is no point in reading all the functions as such. We have seen all these functions just because so that we get a basic idea that strings are very powerful in Python. In fact, when we will learn better concepts in future, we will be using these string functions or string properties a lot. So, let's solve some practice questions on these properties. Let's come to our first practice question which is write a program to input user's first name and print its length. That means first we have to take the first name of the user as input. We had already learnt to take input in our first lecture. And then we have to print the length of the input which we have already learnt to take input in our first lecture and then that input which we have taken in string, we have to print its length, so here before solving mine you have to pause and you have to try to solve this question on your own, after that if we can solve or not, it does not matter but we have to try once and after that we can see the solution, let's remove all of it and first of all let's do our input enter your name and we will store it in a string named name and then we have to print length of your name is len of name. Let's save it and run. Let's suppose I write my name to be Shraddha, then the length of my string will be equal to 7. In this way if we write Aman, then the length of the string will be equal to 4. So we can write any name and we will get the length printed. Let's move on to the second question. Write a program to find the occurrence of dollar in a string. That means how many times does dollar come in a string, we have to print the number of occurrences, that is count. For that we can simply use our count method, we can use the count function. Hi, I am the dollar symbol, dollar 99.99. So in this way we have made any random string. And we can simply print string.count. I have to count the occurrence of dollar. So I know that in my string dollar sign comes 3 times. Let's run it and we will have this number 3. So in this way we can use our string functions when we are dealing with strings. Next we are going to read one more important concept which is conditional statements. Now there are many different conditions in life. For example, we can apply for a voter ID or license only when when our age is 18 plus or there is a condition on our marks. Like if our marks are 90 plus then also we may be getting grade A, if it is between 80 to 90 then also we may be getting grade B. So, in this way there are different different conditions which exist in life. We can express all these conditions in code also. We can express all these conditions in code also. To write conditions in code, we use if, elif and else syntax. Syntax means rules of programming, how to write something. For example, if we want to write a function, like print statement, we will write it like this. This is syntax in Python, syntax the correct way to write code. So now we are going to learn the correct way to write conditional statements. In conditional statements, first of all we will talk about if. Whenever we want to do something on the basis of a condition. For example, if our age is 18 plus, then only we can apply for our license. So we can write if as a keyword and after that we can write a condition in parenthesis. Condition can be anything. Condition can be like we have an age variable whose value is greater than equal to 18. What is this? This is a condition. Condition is basically anything which returns the value of true or false. In condition we can simply write a boolean variable the value of true or false. In condition we can write a boolean variable in which either true or false is present. So if there is a condition in statement which returns true, then any work we write in if, i.e. statement 1 is executed. Let's write this once practically. For example, we make a variable age equals 21. Now if we want that if age is 18 plus, then on its basis we have to decide whether we can apply for license or not. So for that we can write if and then our parenthesis. In parenthesis we will write if age is greater than equal to 18 and then we put colon and then next line. and after that in parenthesis we will write if age is greater than equal to 18 and then we will put colon and then next line now here we have to keep in mind that the next line which will start after this colon we will start that line with a tab space or with 4 spaces in visual studio code by default tab means 4 spaces only so either we will be giving 4 spaces one two three four or by default in visual studio code as soon as we press enter we will come to the distance of the space of the tab and here we will be writing our next statement, this means this statement will be executed when our if statement means if condition will be true so in that case we want to print can vote and apply for license we can print this type of statement so we save it and run it so what will come here here as soon as condition is true means value of age is obviously greater than or equal to 18 so it will give us true and in that case we will print can vote and apply for license but here here if we would have done 16, saved and run, then this time nothing would have been printed for us. If we want, as soon as the statement is true, then there should be two things, then what can we do for that, here we can do our second work, that is, our first statement is done and here we can define our second statement also. So here we can write can drive and can vote. So in this way we can execute two statements together. Let's make our age greater than 18. After saving, we have executed both the lines. Now in this statement, if we wanted, we could have written simply true instead of condition. Simply if we had written simply true, like this, then these statements will be executed for us every time. Now, as we have if, if means if this thing is true then this work should be done. Similarly, we have lf. lf means, if we want to read its expanded version, then we can read it as else if. If the first statement is not true, then we will check this statement in that case. So here in the next line we can write elif and by writing elif we can execute any other statement. For example, we take the example of traffic lights. For example, the color take the example of traffic lights. Let's suppose we have taken the color of our light as green. So here we can check that if the value of our light is red, then what we can do is stop it. In traffic lights, we have three colors red, yellow and green. Red means stop, green means go and yellow means look. So here if our light is red then we have to stop elif means if light is not red then we can check for one more condition that is our light green? if light is green then we will put colon again in next line then we will print go in that case and if light is not green then if we want we can write another lf statement, if our light is yellow then in that case we can print wait or look, we can save and execute, so because our light is green then how will code execution work, in code it will be executed such a way that first we will check whether light is equal to red, obviously it is not. Then we will come to this statement, is light equal to green? Yes, light is equal to green. So in that case we will print go, so here we have got go printed in the output. And as soon as a statement will be executed, then the code will not see the statements after that. Means we will ignore this statement and come out. So here in fact we can also print in the last. End of code save and run. So we have printed go and then end of code. If we want, we can write any number of ifs and any number of elifs in our code in sequence. If we wanted, we could have made this elif as if, so we could have written 3 if statements in this way. And if we wanted, we could have made all of these as elifs. But whenever an elif comes, we always have to write an if statement in the beginning. Now what is the difference between if and elif? There is only such a difference between if and elif that if statement will always check. Means this if statement will always check for the condition. But elif statement will only check when if condition will give false. For example, let's comment out this code once. For example, we have a number. Number is equal to 5. We want to check here that if our number's value is greater than 5 or greater than 3 or 2, then in that case we will print greater than 2 and if we check by doing if here if our number is greater than 3 then in that case we will print greater than 3. Let's save it and execute it. So what will happen first of all our number will be checked if 5 is greater than 2 then we will print greater than 2. Then it will be checked if is because then it will be checked every time. If 5 is greater than 3 then we will print greater than 2 then check if is because then every time check will be 5 is greater than 3 then we will print greater than 3 so in this case when we use if then both the statements will be executed but as soon as we write elif here we will save and rerun then only one statement will be true that is the first one is true only that is true we will not check for second condition in case of elif we check only when our first statement is false. Now as we have if and if, similarly we have an else statement. If and if we can write many times, the beginning is always with if, but else statement we write only once and we are always writing the else statement at the end. Else statement means we do not check any condition in it. Else statement means that we don't check any condition in it. Else statement means that if all the conditions above are false, then else will be run. That means, in our case of traffic light, we come back. For example, in this code, if our light is not red, green or yellow, it means light is broken. Definitely, if we see blue color in traffic light then it doesn't make sense as such. So in this case we can write an else statement, we will put colon means we don't have to check any condition in else statement and here we can print light is broken. For example our traffic light color is pink, so in this case this condition will give false, this will give false, this will also false, so we will get this thing printed. If we execute then we will get print light is broken. Similarly if we make yellow here, then in that case we will get print look. Because red condition will give false, this will give false, here as soon as it is true, this will get printed, in that case else statement will not run. If we want then we can use if and else also. Let's comment out this, let's take our voting example. Let's suppose our age is equal to 24. So, here we can check if our age value is greater than or equal to 18. So, in that case we can print can vote. And we can write a else case if greater than equal to 18 is not there if this statement is false then we have to print in that case cannot vote we can save and execute in this case can vote and when it will be aged equal to 14 in that case we will get print cannot vote so in this way our if, elif and else statements work. Now these are very basic examples, later when we will explore different concepts, we will be writing conditional statements many times. Now here one more thing, whenever we give the space of in else or in elif, this thing is called indentation in programming. Indentation means proper spacing. Generally if we are coming from C, C++, Java background then we must have heard or seen that we combine multiple statements with the help of block of code. That thing does not happen in Python. To write multiple statements in Python, we are using indentation or proper spacing instead of curly braces. That is why indentation or proper spacing is very important in Python from a programming point of view. So these were our basics of conditional statements. Now through one more example, we will understand conditional statements better. For example, we have to write a code, a program in which we want to give grade to our students based on their marks. That means the student who has 90 plus marks should get grade A, the student who has between 80 and 90 should get B, the one who has between 80 and 70 should get C and if he has less than 70 then he should get D. obviously this is a very harsh way of assigning grades but for simplicity we assume that this system is running in a college so how we will convert this system in a code basically its practical scenario is that we have written a program of python in which teacher can enter the marks of the students and for those students grade system will be made as report card. So we have to create this system. So to create this we will use conditional statements. First of all let's come to our first condition. In first condition let's suppose we already have marks. So we will check whether our marks are greater than or equal to 90. If our marks are greater than or equal to 90, then our grade will be 1 equal. After that if this does not happen, then we will check the second condition i.e. Elif. In Elif we will check whether our marks are greater than 80 and less than 90. To check this we have to use our logical operators. That means we will first check whether our marks are greater than or equal to 80. Now greater than or equal to 80 can have any value. Then we will check and, that means if we want to check in our range then we will write and marks are less than 90. So in this way using logical operator we can combine our two conditions. Means marks greater than equal to 80 should be there plus marks less than 90 should also be there. So this statement will also be true and this will also be true. Means marks are in range of 80 to 90. So only our final statement will be true, means marks are in range of 80 to 90, then only our final statement will be true, so in this way we use logical operators in our programming, that both the statements are true then only marks are in our range, in that case what we will print, in that case our grade will be BK equal, and in this way we can write all our statements, once we write its code, for example we have some marks, Let's suppose the marks are equal to 74. We can start writing our conditions. If our marks are greater than or equal to 80 and marks are less than 90. In that case our grade will be B. Next we are going to write L if our marks are greater than or equal to 70 and marks are less than 80 so in that case grade is going to be C and here we can write our else case else grade is going to be equal to D and in last we can print grade of the student are grade. Let's save and refresh so grade of the student is going to be C. Now here the marks we can take it as input from the user. Enter student marks. Let's save it and let's run it. Let's suppose our student's marks are 94 equal. Let's cast it into int, save and run. So student's marks are 94, the grade is going to be A. Again we can check, student's marks are 67, grade is going to be D. Student's marks are 88, the grade is going to be B. So in this way we have made a complete program for ourselves in which something is getting input, then some operation is being performed, then finally we are doing some output. Generally, programs work in the same way in programming languages. That is, first we are taking some input, then we perform some operations, and finally some output is done, which as a result we send out from our program. Now with conditional statements, there is also something called nesting. Nesting means writing if statement inside if. That means, when we write another statement inside one statement. For example, we have written a condition. This is how our if statement is. And inside this, when we write another if statement, that is, this proper spacing, with it, in some other condition, if we want, we can write another if statement with some other condition, then we have to give a gap from here and we can print anything here. This phenomenon is called nesting in programming. Nesting is writing the second statement in one statement. And this is completely valid in Python. For example, we have age, let's suppose the age is equal to 34, we are checking if the age is greater than or equal to 18, in that case we are printing can drive something like this and else we are printing cannot drive. Now, there is no upper age limit for driving but for example we have an imaginary upper age limit that driving is not possible from 80+. We imagine a scenario like this. imagine. So here in this statement if we want to check that once the age is greater than equal to 18, if we want to check in that if the age is also greater than equal to 80, so here we want to print something. Let's suppose we want to print cannot drive, in this way we want to print something but if this thing is not true then in that case we want to print this thing so this code is also completely valid in fact what we are using in this code we are using nesting in this code nesting means to write other statements in one if statement save it if age is 34 then in this case it will be printed can drive but as soon as we will make our age let's suppose 95 save and rerun then in that case it will be printed cannot drive so here as soon as first statement will be true then we will go inside and check second statement again if this is true then we will print this thing and if this thing is false then we will print this statement so in this way nesting also works in programming here we have seen nesting in conditional statements in future we will read important concept of loops in next lectures in which we can do nesting in loops also now let's come to some practice questions first of all we have to try to solve these practice questions ourselves and after that we can see it with the class. First practice question is write a program to check if a number entered by the user is odd or even. Now to solve this question let's think about odd and even numbers. Our odd numbers can start from 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 all these are our odd numbers. Similarly we have even numbers, in even numbers we have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and so on. Now odd and even numbers have a special property, all the even numbers, all the even numbers, can we say that they are multiples of 2, all the even numbers come in the table of 2. Or there is another better way to say that they are multiples of 2, all the even numbers come in the table of 2. Or there will be another better way to say that all the even numbers are completely divided by 2. That means if we divide any even number by 2, then always the remainder will be 0. Like if we divide 14 by 2, then the remainder is going to be equal to 0. So can we say that any number, if it is divided by 2 and gives 0 as the remainder, then it is an even number. We can definitely say that. If any number is divided by 2 and gives 0 the remainder, if its value is 0, then it means it is an even number. And any number which does not give a remainder of 0, all the remaining numbers are odd numbers. Let's check this thing, i.e. convert it in the program. Let's suppose we have some number equal to 40. Now here we can either find out a remainder first, numModulo2. If our remainder is equal to 0, then we can print even in that case. And in the else case, we can print odd, like this. In fact, this number can be taken as input from the user. Enter number. Save and run. First of all we will enter our number 14. Our 14 is an even number. Or if we enter 1, 1 is an odd number. So this way we can calculate or directly we can calculate and check this remainder check instead of creating a new variable. We have saved and refreshed, the number 24 is an even number and the number 17 is an odd number. Let's come to the next question. Next question is, write a program to find the greatest of 3 numbers entered by the user. That means the user will give us 3 numbers A, B and C. This can be anything. We have to write a program which will find out the largest value from these 3. For example, let's suppose A has 4, B has 5 and C has 7. So, in this way we have 3 numbers. Now, first of all we can check that is A greater than B? If A is greater than B and A is greater than C then in that case what can we say that if A is greater than both the numbers then our greatest number will be A or if it is not like that, means A is not the greatest number then in L if we can check that is B greater than C? We obviously know that if the first statement is not true then it means A is not the greatest number. So it means either B is greatest or C is greatest. So first check if B is greater than C? If B is greater than C then it means B is greater number and in the case of else it is C greater number. Let's write it in the code once and see. Let's suppose we enter the number, input it from the user or enter first number, we will store it in A and similarly we will enter these numbers, we will store one in B and one in C. First of all we will check if A is greater than B and we can also say greater than equal to B and A is greater than equal to print. First number is greatest or largest and first number's value also gets printed which is a. lf if it becomes greater than or equal to c then in that case we will print number 2nd is the largest 2nd is largest and we will print the value of b and in the else case we obviously know that our number c will be the greatest so 3rd is largest and c we will save it and run it first of all let's suppose we input 4, in second number we input 5 and in third number we input 7. So the answer is third is largest which is 7. If we want we can run our code with some different values. Let's suppose first number is 99, second number is 201 and third number is 87. Our largest number will be second number which is equal to 201. So, in this way our program is finished. Here I will give you a homework problem that as we have written code to find out largest of 3, similarly you have to write code to find out largest of 4 numbers. And you have to think this code first logically on paper pen and after that we will convert it in Python code. Now let's come to our third question, in third question it says write a program to check if a number is a multiple of 7 or not, any number is a multiple of any other number when its remainder is 0, means if we take any number x and if we want to check what is this multiple of 7 then its remainder should be 0. For example, for x is equal to 7 or for 14 or 21 or 28, for all these numbers with 7 their remainder will be 0. So all these numbers will become multiple of 7. We can also write code for this. Let's suppose we took a number input, let's call it x, enter number and if whatever number is x, its remainder with 7 turns out to be 0, then in that case we will print multiple of 7 and in the else case we will print not a multiple. So we save it and enter. We entered 21 so 21 is a multiple of 7 and if we enter again let's suppose 16, so 16 is not a multiple of 7 and we can check this not only for 7 but for any number. For example we can check if any number is multiple of 5 save and run if we enter 25 then 25 is a multiple of 5 but if we enter 27 then 27 is not a multiple of 5 so this is the basic code by which we have practiced our questions obviously when we do real life programming the logic we build there is more complex than this. But for that as a beginner we have many more different concepts in python which we have to learn. So I hope that from today's lecture we will be learning more concepts about python language. keep learning and keep practicing.

# Lecture 3
 Hi everyone and welcome to the complete Python series in which we will be covering all the important concepts of Python language. Today we are going to read our chapter 3 in which we will be covering tuples and lists in Python. We will not only read concepts, we will be writing our code related to concepts. Along with that we will be solving different practice questions related to concepts. So, let's start with our chapter 3. Hi everyone, and now we are going to start with our chapter 3 in Python. In chapter 3, we are going to cover about lists and tuples in Python. Now if we talk about list first, generally if you have coded in any other programming language, then you must have heard about arrays, which is a data structure named arrays. Now in Python, arrays have sort of equivalent lists and tuples. Now list is a built-in data type that stores set of values. For example, we are a teacher of a class and we have to store the marks of many students. Now there will be one way that we can take our file of Python. Here we have made a file in our folder named lecture3.py. And in this file, we have 5 students and we have to store marks of 5 students so first we make the first variable marks1 is equal to 94.4 like this then make the second variable marks2 is equal to 87 make the third variable marks3 is equal to 95 make the fourth variable marks 4 is equal to 66 and marks 5 equals 45. In this way we have made 5 variables. In fact we convert them to floating values. In this way we have stored different marks. Now our class size is limited, that is only 5 students. Tomorrow there may be 50 students or 100 students in our class. Now for every student, for a simple thing like marks, if we start making a new variable, then we will have to track a lot of variables whenever we are coding. So to simplify this work, we got a built-in data type. Built- in data type means this data type and its related methods or functions are already written in python and we don't need to implement them. Now if I have to store these marks in a list then simply we make a single variable marks and simply write marks dot something. So what happens what happens with this marks is equal to 12 means that we have this marks this is an integer variable similarly if I want to store multiple lists of values so to make a list first we write our square brackets and then we start writing our values in square brackets we can store as many values as we want in a single list and we have to write those values by separating them from comma. For example, the first value we have is 94.4 comma, we can give spaces if we want, but we don't have to give, it's up to us, 95.2, 66.4 and similarly 45.1. So, in this way, this built-in data type that in data type we call it a list in python now this python list we have if we want we can print it also let us try to print our list, what name we have given to list like a normal variable we give name to it similarly we have given name to our list as marks. Let's save and run. Our list has been printed. If we want we can print the type of the list. Type of marks Save and run. So we have the class and the list. This type of structure of this data is a list type. Now many properties of list will look similar to strings. Like in strings, there was concept of indexing, we could go to a particular index and find a character. Similarly, in list, we can go to a particular index and access a particular element. For example, if we have a list like this, if we write marks of 0, then we will get the marks of 0th index. 1 index will be this, 2 index, 3 index and 4 index. Let's try to print our values. We can print marks of 0 here. And let's try to print marks of 1. Let's save it and let's run it. So our marks at 0th index came, and our marks at 1st index came. And in this way we can access all the indices. If we want we can print the length of our list also. Like here instead of type if I do len, like we used to print the length of string, similarly we can print the length of marks. Save it, refresh it, so what we got? So we got 5 here, which is the length of this list. Now the list of Python is slightly different from the arrays that we create in C++ and Java. That means in C++ and Java, generally in these languages, in programming languages, the arrays that we read, the data that we can that we can store should be of the same type. But in Python there is no such rule in the list. That means in our Python list we can store elements of different types together. If we want we can make a list of student names in which we can store details of a particular student. This is his name, Karan, and what is this? This is of string type, this is of marks, this is of integer type, this is of location, place, state, anything. So this is also of string type, we can add floating values or some other values. So in this way we can store multiple type of data together in a single list. Like if I create a student list, then we can save the student's name in it, we can save his marks, we can save his age and we can save his location. We have saved it and if we want we can print the information of our student and this is going to be a valid list in python. Now I have said that the list of string and python is very similar but there is a big difference between the two and the difference is that in python the strings that we have strings are immutable in python this is a very important point and lists are mutable in python. Now what is the meaning of mutable and immutable? To mutate means to change, in English mutable means something that can change and immutable means something that can't change. Like we have mortal and immortal means the one who can live, can die and can't live. Similarly we have mutable and immutable things that can change and that cannot change. So in Python like in strings, it was allowed to access value on index but it was not allowed to change value there i.e. to mutate. But in list this is also allowed and this is also allowed. For example if we take any string, let's take an example of a string, here we have a string hello, now if we want we can print str of 0 in hello, but if I say that I want to assign value of str of 0 as y equal, this operation is not allowed by python because strings are immutable, there't be changed. Here error will come, string object does not support item assignment. We can't do this assignment. But this same thing is possible in list. Means if we want, we can print student of 0. And tomorrow it may happen that student's name by changing name, let's suppose Arjun. So this thing is completely possible in Python. In this case, Python will not return any error. And if we want, we can print our new list, our student list. Let's save it and run it. So we have a new list in which the value has changed because lists are mutable in Python. Also, like there is a limit in the index in the string, that means if we make a list here, let's take an example of this list, if index 0, 1 and 2 are there, then if we try to access index 3, then it will give us an error. Like here, in this list, we have 4 indices possible. This value is for index 0, this is for index 1, this is index 2, this is index 3. So here, if I try to write 5, it will give me an error. Here we will get an error list index out of range. So we can access our values within the range of indices. Now, as string slicing was possible within strings, similarly slicing is possible within lists as well. What was the problem behind slicing? That we should have index. Now, as index is there within strings, so is possible in the list. What was the problem behind slicing? That we should have index. Now, just like index is there in the string, so is the index in the list. So, obviously, slicing should also be possible here. So, to do slicing, the same rules remain which we had read in the time of strings. That is, we write the name of our list, then we write the starting index, then we write the ending index. So, what we get is a piece of our our list which we can call as sub list. Sub list means a piece of the list. What was substring? It was a piece of string. So the sub list is a piece of the list. So in sub list from this starting index to this ending index all the values come just before. Just like in string slicing, in list slicing also ending index is not included. For example, if we have this marks list and if we write 1 to 4, we need all the sub lists. So let's see the index once, this will be index 0, this will be index 1, this will be index 2, 3 and 4. So from 1 to 4 means that all the values from 1 to 3 will be returned to us. Let's test this also. Let's try to make another list called marks. In marks we have 85, 94, 76, 63, 48. In this way we have stored different marks. And now if we want a sub list, marks of 1 to 4, so we will have 94, 76 and 63. Let's save and run, so we will have these three values returned. Now as we had learned in string slicing that if we miss the starting index then automatically starting index will count from 0, if we refresh then values will come from 84 and if we give starting index but miss ending index then automatically last index will become our ending index. That means values will start from 94 and all values till 48 will come to us. Now here one more important thing that just like in string slicing we had negative index, similarly in this list also we have negative index. Means if we have made some list like this, then in that negative index will start from here also from minus 1, then minus 2, then minus 3, then minus 4, then minus 5. So if we want we can do slicing on the basis of negative index also. For example if you want to go from minus 3 to minus 1 then minus 3 will be included and minus 2 will be included. Here if we want to go from minus 3 to minus 1 then we will get values 76 and 63. Let's save and refresh. So we will get these two values printed. Now inside strings we had read the basics of strings, after that we had read slicing and after that we had read some methods. Similarly, we have read the basics in the list, we have read slicing, and now we are going to talk about some methods of the list. Methods means functions, like till now we have been using our print function. What is print function? Print function is for everyone, we can print anything in our print function, similarly we have been using our length function, length means it will print the length of our string, it will print the length of our list, and when we will read another data structure tuple, it will print the length of our tuple also, but what are methods? methods are specific if we are reading a method for string then it is not necessary that same method can be used for list so that's why list specific methods are like functions means they perform some work but they are only list specific means they perform some work on the list now we are going to read functions and methods in detail but before that if we will build some basic ideas like this, practical knowledge because we have already used methods and functions, so if we know basic things then we will feel better in the future. Now for example we have this list which has values 2, 1 and 3. So in this the first method which we will be reading is the append method. Append means in English to add something in the last. So the same thing our append method does that whatever value we pass in it, whatever element we pass, we can pass only one element, it adds that element in our list in the last. So if we append in the list 4, then 4 will be added in the list in the last. We can can check this also. Like let's create a list. We keep values 2, 1 and 3 in it and if we want then we can append value 4 in the list. And after that if we update our list then new value will be added in it and our final output is 2,1,3 and 4. Now here one more interesting thing is that as we added this element in our list, this thing is called mutating the list, mutating means we changed our list, its values have changed, so this mutation is allowed in the list. Second method we have is sort. SORT means sorting things. SORTing is a very important concept in programming. SORTing means to arrange things in the right order. Generally when we talk about sorting, it means that we are arranging things in the right order from small to big. We have two types of sorting, one is ascending and other is descending. Ascending order means small values will come first then big values and then big values. Descending means first big values will come then small values and then more small values. For example if there are numbers then if we write 012 then it is ascending order and 210 is descending order. List has a sort method, if we write list.sort then our list will automatically be sorted in ascending order. Like here if we write list.sort then our list will be sorted and we don't need to do anything like this means we think that list is sorted here but who knows it returns sorted list or not list.sort function does not return anything it returns none value means if I try to print list.sort let's remove this for once so what will be printed we will will have a NUN print. NUN means nothing, we discussed this earlier. Means this sort function, sort method is not returning anything. What is it doing? It is going inside the original string and doing changes. So that's why we have a NUN print here. Now if we want to print our list after NUN, we can print it like this. Let's rerun it. So we will have our list 1, 2, 3. so what happened, it was automatically arranged in ascending order, okay if before sorting here, we want to append in the list, value 4, so that is also possible, but as soon as we call list.append4, what will it do, it will add 4 in the list, but this append method does not return anything. So what will be printed here? Here also I have a none print. So let's save it and run it. So first append 4 is done but what did the function method return? None returned so here none is printed. That there was no value to return to it. Generally the methods of string which we have already read, what did those methods return? Those methods return the new updated string value. Then the list has been sorted but did not return anything. And finally if we print the list, then it is a sorted list. Now if we want we can sort our list in descending order also. How? We just have to write in our method this statement reverse equal to true. If we want to do sorting in reverse order then we can simply write this value and send it. Here if I have done reverse equal to true with a capital T. Many beginners try to write with small t then we get error. So we don't have to do that, we save it and let's run it. So now our list is sorted in descending order. Now the sorting does not apply only on numbers, it applies on characters and strings also. How? If instead of 213, there are values in the list, let's suppose we have banana, we have lychee and we have mango, or to make it simple let's call it apple, let's save it and let's comment out and let's run it, so here if we have sorting in descending order then what was printed? First lychee was printed then banana then apple. And here if we did sorting in ascending order then first apple was printed then banana then lychee. Because how will sorting be done in strings in apple? The character which comes first will generally come first in ascending order. So if A comes before B then apple will also come before banana. Now if B comes before L then banana will also come before lychee. So in this way sorting is possible in strings. To make it more simple we can write some characters d, e, f, c and b. Let's save this and as soon as we sort this list, we will have all the characters A, B, C, D, E, F. So in this way it is possible to sort the characters and strings. Next method which we will talk about is our reverse method. Reverse method turns the whole list and this change which is the one which is to be turned, the one which is to be reversed, it does it in the original string only. For example if I have this list, if I want to do this list completely opposite then what we will do is we can do, in fact here we can do list.reverse, so in the original list all these values will be reversed. Let's run it. If b was in last then we have b in first, c in second last, c in second, f in third last, so f in third and in this way we have the whole list reversed. Next method is insert method. Insert method works very similar to append but it adds things to a particular index. If we have a list and we want to insert a new value somewhere in the middle, then we will use insert method. We will pass two values in it. First we want to insert something on which index and second we want to add which element we want to add. For example in this list, if we talk about index, this is index 0, this is index 1, this is index 2. If I want the value above index 1 to be 5, then we can write list.insert I want the value 5 above index 1. So what changes will be there in the list, before 1 everything will be same, if there was 2 on 0 index then here also 2 will be there, now if value 5 will come on index 1 then we will have 5, and after that whatever values were there including index 1, all that will come later, in the same order, 1 will also come here, 3 will also come here, so our new list will look like this. Let's try this, for example we have this list 2, 1, 3, if we insert in this list index 1 with value 5 and print our list, then our list will be 251 and 3 which is the same value as this list. Next method which we will talk about is our remove method. Remove method works to remove the first occurrence of an element. If we have this list 2131, if we want to remove 1 in it, then what will the remove method do? It will find the first 1 in this list and will remove it from the list. So we will have the final list like this. And similar to remove, we have the pop method. The work of pop method is to delete a value by going to a particular index. For example, if we have this index 0, 1, 2 and 3. I want the index 2 element to be completely deleted. So what will come in the final list? 2, 1, 2 and 3. I want the element of index 2 to be completely deleted. So final list will be 2, 1, 1. Like here if we do list.pop, I want to pop the value at index 2. We will save and refresh, so elements 2, 1 and 1 will be saved in the list. So these are the frequently used methods in Python's list. but apart from this there are many different methods. In fact if I write list and dot then Visual Studio Code will suggest me many methods. We have already seen append, clear, copy, count, extend, we have many different methods. Copy method works by making a copy of a list and returns it. Which we can store in another variable. So the same elements come in the list. Count method is to count the occurrence of a particular element and in this way we have different methods. So if we want we can search for Python documentation. We can search on google for Python documentation and the official documentation of python from there we can search different methods by the way day to day maximum programming related methods we have already covered many of them and in general if you do programming whether you are doing development or machine learning if we have a method we know the logic but we don't remember the exact name then either we can take help of visual code suggestions or while doing practical development we can simply go and search on google so all our answers are available online now we have talked about list in python there is one more built in data type which we call tuples tuples we can understand in this way that tuples are the brother of list the way list works almost the same way. In fact, if we were reading any other programming language, then generally we would have used list in it. It could have been that I don't teach you tuples in the tutorial. But because tuples are used so much in Python, practically used a lot in day to day programming, so that's why we would be covering tuples too. Now in python tuple is a built in data type that lets us create immutable sequence of values. So this is the biggest difference between list and tuple. What is list? We have already discussed that list is a mutable data type whose value can be changed. But what is tuple? Tuple is immutable. Just like strings. What are strings? Strings are also immutable. Once you have made a tuple, we can't change its values. We can't add new elements in it. We can't delete old elements from it. So what do we have to do to make tuple the process is same as we make list but instead of square brackets what happens here is we use parenthesis so if I want to convert this list to some tuple then we just have to put parenthesis here so what is this? this is tuple so nothing to do just put parenthesis here so what is this now I have tuple, if we want we can give name also tuple let's give it a name tuple and we will print type of this variable so we will save it so what will come we have class printed as tuple equal means what is this it is a built in data type whose type is tuple. Now in tuple also like a list we can access our index. If I want I can print tuple of 0 or tuple of 1 in this way we can print values. But like in list we can write tuple of 0 equals 5. This operation is not allowed in tuples because tuples are obviously immutable so in that we are not allowed to do assignment, we cannot change the value by going to any index. Like if we try to run this code we will get an error tuple object does not support item assignment, this error is very similar to the one that we got when we were trying to assign a new value on an index inside a string. Now if we want we can create different types of tuples. For example, I can create an empty tuple. If we put a parenthesis then it becomes an empty tuple. We can also print this empty tuple and also we can print its type also. What is this? This is a valid tuple, means there are no elements in it. When we will run, it will be empty print and we will have class print tuple. Whenever in a tuple we have single element, like here we have element 1, we will always separate a single element with a comma and create our tuple. So this is the right way to create a single value tuple. Like if we save and run this, then this is our single value tuple and this is our type of this tuple. Now here we can have a question in our mind that why not I remove this comma from here, then what will happen to me in that case? I will tell you what will happen in that case, in that case this thing, this value will be understood by python as an integer. That is, what is this? This is just an integer 1, like we do not write in python 1 plus 2, so we can write the value in parentheses, it is completely normal. Similarly, python will think that you have just written a normal integer with parentheses. And now if we run the code, then 1 will be printed in value, that is, the bracket is ignored. And what is its type? Its type integer will be printed. Similarly, if 1.0 was here, then it would have taken the type float and if there was a string here, Hello, then it would have taken the type string. But if we want it to be perceived as a string here, hello, then we can take the type string. But if we want to perceive it as a tuple, then for that, it is compulsory to put a comma with single values in Python. When we have multiple values, what should we do? In the case of multiple values, we have a choice. If we want, we can write our values separately from the comma, but putting a comma at last putting comma this thing is completely optional. That means if we put comma then also there will be no error and if we don't put then also there will be no error but still our data will be perceived like tuple. So this way there are multiple ways to create multiple types of tuples. Now as we do slicing in strings and in list, similarly slicing in tuples is also possible. Slicing in tuples works exactly the same way as it works in list and in string. Like if I want I can print tuple of, if we print values from 1 to 3, then we will get 2 and 3, we will save and run. So this part of our tuple will be printed. Next we are going to talk about methods inside tuple. So inside tuple we will cover two important methods. The first method is index method. If we want to find an element inside a tuple, that when was the first time that element came. So for that we can use our index method. For example, if we write indices in this tuple, this will be 0, 1, 2 and 3. If we want to find element 1, we have done tuple.index1, so we have value is equal to 1, so element 1 is coming first time on index1. For example, in this tuple, if we want to find element 2, we can write tuple.index of element 2 save and run. Then we will get value of 1. What is this 1? This is 1 index. What is this 2? This is 2 element for which we want to search. Similarly we have count method. In tuple.count, whatever element we pass, how many times that element element passes in tuple, its count returns to us. Like here if I pass tuple.count, then how many times 2 comes? 2 comes once. So I will get print 1. But here if 2 comes 3 times, then we get print value equals 3. So in this way our lists and tuples work in python. So these are the concepts which we have read. Now we are going to solve some practice questions based upon the same concepts. First of all let's look at the questions. Also whatever questions are there, first of all we have to understand the question, after that we have to pause the lecture and try to solve the question by ourselves. Because until we try to solve the question by ourselves in programming, our brain's horses don't start running. Logic at the end is built in programming, in coding, when we sit and think things by ourselves. It is possible that we think about the answer to the question and we solve it now. We can even Google the answer, then also we solve it now and finally we have to see the solution in the lecture but that is not a problem when we think about something it may be that we may not be able to solve the question completely but still our logic is built because we learn to think in terms of coding so as a beginner to solve things by yourself to try new things is a good habit which we have to build along with it. First question is asking us to write a program to ask the user to enter names of their 3 favorite movies and store them in a list. What we have to do is enter 3 movies from the user, number 1, number 2, number 3 and these 3 movies will be strings and we have to make a list by combining these three strings. So the way to solve this is that we can think of it as we will input the first movie, second input, third input and then we will append all three in our list. So let's do this and see. Let's input enter first movie. In this way, here we can store the value in the name of movie1. Then what we will do is, we will make another list. With the name movies, what will be the list in the beginning? In the beginning the list will become an empty list. What we can do is, in movies, or in fact, we can take all the values as input at once. This will be movie1, this will be movie2, this will be our second movie and this will be movie3, this will be our third movie. What we will do in the last is, we will append our movie1 in movies, then append your movie2 to movies, then append your movie3 to movies. Shutter Island and Lucy and probably Primer. This way, okay. In the end we forgot to print our list. Let's try to print our movies list. Let's rerun our code and add same movies. So our complete list is created. Now in this code we could have done one or two more changes. For example here we append our movie. And instead of making different variables we assign the same value in the same variable again and again. Same value here and here also. Save and run. So our output returns the same to us. Or we can directly append it. To append it directly means we don't need this movie variable. We can simply write movies.append and add our input inside it. So this is the way to append movies directly. Then we don't have to write this extra line. I am just telling you this extra. If you have solved the question yourself and we have written lines in the same way, then there is no problem in that. Means that is the correct code. There is no issue at all. Here we can delete these values in this way. And then let's try to print our movies first of all enter first movie we will enter this we will enter second movie ok we didn't write input in front of third movie but I hope you get the gist that this way we can add all our movies in our list let's come to the next question and we are going to do something interesting in this question. In the question we are being asked, write a program to check if a list contains a palindrome of elements or not. Palindrome can be a word if we are doing programming for the first time, then we have heard it for the first time. What does palindrome? Palindrome means things which are same from front and back. For example, if I talk about a string, I have a string M A A, M, what is this? This is a palindrome. In this, from the beginning, we will read MAM, from the last we will read MAM. If I take a string race car In this if we read from the beginning then also we will read race car If we read from the last then also we will read race car RACECAR So what happened is that these are palindromes Similarly a list can also be a palindromic list For example if we read from the beginning then also we will get 12321 If we read from the last then also we will get 12321 If we read from the beginning, then also 1,2,3,2,1 will come, if we read from the last, then also 1,2,3,2,1 will come. If we read from the beginning, then first 1 will come, then A,B,C will come, if we read from the last, then also 1 will come, then A,B,C will come. So palindromes are those lists in which from the beginning and from the last, same number of elements are shown in the same order. So we have to check whether a list is a palindromic list or not. And to do this there is a hint that is given to us that we can use our copy method. What is the copy method in the list? In the list, we can search in VS code also. If I create a list of elements 1,2,3. So we can click on this arrow. And what does list.copy method do? Returns a shallow copy of the list means we will get the shallow copy of our list what is shallow copy and what is deep copy? we will read this later but for now we can think that if there was already a list 1,2,3 then it will become a duplicate of this in memory 1,2,3 this will return to us so we have to check whether a list is palindromic or not. Now, whether anything is palindrome or not, there is a simple way to check it in programming. If anything is the same from the beginning, if we are reading from the beginning, then it is the same and if we are reading from the end, then it is the same. So what does it mean? It is a palindrome, it is a palindromic thing. We already know this. But what I say is, for example this is a list that we have, if we make a copy of this list, this original is the same, we made a copy of it, in copy we got 1 first, then we reverse this copy, if we reverse the copy, then the last value came first, then 2 came, then 3 came, then 2 came, in this way. And in the end we have 1. I am saying that if this original value and the value that comes after copying and reversing if both the values are same then any value becomes palindrome and this is the way that we solve for palindromes in programming. Similarly we generally check for palindrome. Let's take one more example of this. For example there is a list which is not palindrome. I have 123, 123 is not palindrome. From front it will be 123 and from back it will be 321. If I make a copy of this, I will get 123 and then I will reverse it. So, after reversing it, 321 will come. Can 123 and 321 be same? Absolutely not. So, what is this? It is not palindrome. But if it was 121 here, then 121 would have 1 here and here too these two would be same and this would be palindrome so making copy and reverse means that we are learning things from last so what we can do is make copy of any list and reverse it and check original and copy list is same or not if it is same then it is palindrome and if it is not then it is not palindrome. For this same logic we are going to write code. Let's create this list1. Let's save a palindrome inside list1 and this is my list2. Let's save a non palindrome inside list2. First we will make a copy of list1.copy. This method will give us copy. Then we will reverse this list. So copy of list1. will be reversed. And now we will check that if copy of list1 is equal to mylist1 if both the values are same then in that case we can print palindrome and in the else case we will print not palindrome we will save it and run it so we have a palindrome let's save this and run it so we have a palindrome because 1 to 1 is a palindrome but if I put the same value in list 1 i.e. if we make list 1 as 1 to 3 then what will be printed in that case in that case it will be printed as not palindrome let's write another palindrome like here if I write M A A M If I run then this is a palindrome What is this? We have a palindromic list available But if we write another P here then it becomes not palindrome So this way we can solve for our list related to palindrome for our list. Let's move towards the next question. Next question is, write a program to count the number of students with grade A in the following tuple. What is this? This is going to be a tuple. We can give it a name as grades. We have to bring the count of all the students who scored A in this. So, for that we can use the count method of tuple. Let's try to recreate this tuple. We will call it grade and to create tuple we will put parenthesis. We will copy our grades. First C is coming then D is coming. Then we have A, another A, B, another B and finally A. We can simply print grade.count of grade A. Save and run. We have got the value 3k equal. Next question is, store the above values in a list and sort them from A to D. That means,ple, this same values we have to create in the form of a list and then we have to sort them from A to D what is the meaning of A to D? A to D means ascending order means small character first and big character later so here we can create a list for this using our square brackets and we can write grade dot or simply grade dot sort and then we will print our grade. Let's save it and run it. What are the values? Now the are now arranged in sorted order from A to D, so in this way we work in python with list and tuples, so I hope you have enjoyed reading new concepts in python and the notes and slides of today's lecture you will get in the description box below from there we can access them, see you in next lecture till then keep learning and keep practicing.

# Lecture 4
 Hi everyone and welcome to the complete Python series in which today we will cover our chapter 4 in which we will be reading about dictionaries and sets. Dictionaries and sets are very important data structures or they are built-in data types in Python which we use very frequently in Python. So we are going to cover all the things about their will not only read the topics but we will also code the things related to it and at last we will use all the concepts and solve some practice questions for a better understanding. Along with that you will get the notes of our lecture in the description box which we can download and if we want to read any other topic related to python then all the chapters will be available in this playlist on this channel, which we can go and see. So let's start with our chapter 4. Hi everyone, so now we are going to start with our chapter 4, in which we will read about dictionaries and sets. Now first of all, let's talk about dictionary in python the way in real life we have dictionary in dictionary we have word meaning pairs means we have a specific word and then all the meanings can be written in one place then next word is written then its meanings are written then next word is written then its meaning is written so in this way our dictionary works in the form of pairs, where one is word and one is meaning. Now in dictionary our words act like a key. To act like a key means that whenever I have to find the meaning of a word, we will simply search that word in our dictionary. Generally we don't search meaning we start searching through word so we say this is the key of our pair key means important thing and meaning is basically a value of this key so if we have to store this type of information in python then we store it in the form of dictionary data values now before this we have to store it in Python, so we store it in the form of dictionary data values. Now before this we have read about lists and tuples which are built in in Python. Similarly dictionaries and sets are also built in in Python. So dictionaries are used to store data values in key value pairs. That is, there will be a key then there will be its value, there will be a key then there will be its value. So to create a dictionary, first we write the name of our dictionary like a normal variable, then we write equal to and in curly braces we write our key value pairs. Like here this is a single key value pair in which key is name which is our string, in between we have divided it with colon and this is value which is a string. After that this is our second key value pair in which this is our key, a string and this is our value, a floating value. So, in this way we can create multiple key value pairs. Let's make our own dictionary. For example, we are storing some information. We are storing some information and to store it in the form of dictionary, we just have to put curly braces. And then we have to start writing our key value pairs. Like what happened here, this is our this is our string and this is its value we can make a name like this name is our key and value is we can add any name in value we have one more key and one more value so this is our dictionary we can print our dictionary if we want we have given name and information, let's run it so we have our dictionary printed and the key value pairs are separated with a comma this is a single key value pair and this is a single key value pair if we want, the values are not string, we can store other data types in it, not just the values. For example, if I take a key age, then we can store values in it. Let's suppose 35, 35 becomes an integer. If we make a key named isAdult, then we can store true in it. What is true? It is a boolean value or if we make a key named marks then we can store value in it, 94.4, so what is this? It is a floating value. All the values of this type are acceptable in a dictionary. If we want we can store lists and tuples also. That means here let's remove these values and add a name again. In name we will get a string value. Apart from that we can create another key which we will call subjects. And in subjects we can store our list of subjects. In this we will write python, in this we will write c, in this we will write, Java and so on. So what happened is that a list is created and a tuple can also be made. Like if we want to store today's topics, then we can store them in the form of a tuple, dictionary and set. Let's save and run. So these different data types will be printed on the screen. Now, the values in the dictionary, almost all data types are acceptable. But the keys, we cannot use the list and dictionary in it. We can make the keys as a string. If we want, we can make our key as a number. Like our key can be 12. This will also be completely acceptable. If we want, we can make our key can be simply 12. This will also be completely acceptable. If we want, we can make a floating value for our key. Save it, rerun it. So, this can be a floating value, this can be a Boolean value. Or if we want, we can make it a tuple. Basically, there should be a value which is assigned once and then it doesn't change later. Like what can be a list? In a list, elements can be added or removed. It can be changed. removed, it changes. Similarly, a dictionary is also mutable. You can add elements in a dictionary, remove them, and the dictionary changes. But since tuple doesn't change, we can only make the tuple our key. Rest, we generally keep our primitive types. In fact, the dictionaries we see, we will encounter strings only. So, we won't go into so much complexity in dictionary that we are making tuple our key or we are making floating values our key or we are making integers our key we will keep our normal key values as strings only because in majority scenarios as a beginner in the same way dictionaries make sense for us now if we want we can also print the type of dictionary like if I try to print type of info, we will get dict type. Now, there are some properties of dictionary. First of all, dictionaries are unordered. Unordered means there is no fixed rule that which thing will come first and which thing will come last. That means, the strings or the list or the tuple. What is common in all of them is that there is an index in all of them. Some have index of 0, some have index of 1, some have index of 2, some have index of 1, some have index of 2. So we get to know which value is coming first and which value is coming later. But in dictionaries, as such, there is no index. So that is why there is no order in dictionaries. Apart from that dictionaries are mutable that means we can change them like we can't change tuple tuple was immutable we can change list, list is mutable like list is mutable, so dictionary is also mutable and we can't create duplicate keys if we want to have two keys one key has name and other key has name then that thing is not possible in the dictionary. Like in real life dictionary, when we store word meanings, then one word is written only once. Yes, we can write different meanings together, but we write one word only once. It is not like after 10 pages, the definition of apple or cat will come again. So, similarly, here also in these dictionaries, we do not repeat the keys. Now, if we have created any dictionary for ourselves, if we want to access its values, then instead of index, what we can do is, by writing the name of the dictionary, by putting square brackets, we can write the name of our key. And through the name of the key, we can access its value. For example, this is our information dictionary. Or to give it a better name, we can call it dictionary. Let's call it dict. So for our information dictionary, if we want to access its values, we can print our square brackets in information and after that if I want to print the name, we can simply write name. Similarly if we want to print our topics then we can write topics. If we want to print our subjects then we can write subjects and we can write age. Let's run it. So we will get all these individual values printed. Let's make it our college and all the values will be printed. Now here if we write a key like this, instead of name if I write surname. So surname does not exist in this information dictionary so we will get an error in that case. We will get a key error that surname key is not present in this dictionary. For example, we try to access an index like this in a string, in a list, in a tuple which doesn't exist which is bigger than its size or smaller than its size then in that case, as we get an error similarly, if we pass a key that doesn't exist then in that case also we will get an error. If we want to change our name and assign some other value then that thing is also possible. We can simply write name in information and to assign new value we can write equal to, i.e. assignment operator and let's suppose I assign this value. Let's save it and once again let's print our information. Let's refresh. So what happened here is that we got the value of our name changed. And in the same way if we want we can add a new value in the same way like if I want we can add this thing in name and here we can take a value of surname let's save it and run so in dictionary name value has been college but we have reassigned its value so new value came here. Along with that we added a new key value pair, the way we do assignment we can add a new key value pair very easily in dictionary. So with all these actions we get to know that dictionaries in python are mutable, we can change their values. Now in this if we want to create another name by writing in this way with a new value then that thing is not possible because in that case what will happen is that the old value will be overwritten. So instead of creating a new key value pair with the same key, Python overwrites the old key value. And it is not necessary that we assign it as a string, we can assign it as a number or some other value, so here name will be 23, simply like this. If we want, we can create an empty dictionary, for example, I want to create a null dictionary, null means empty, so we can write a parenthesis like this, so we will get is an empty dictionary created. If we want we can print this also. This is going to be my null dictionary. Let's remove this part. Let's save it and run it. So we got a null dictionary. And if we want we can add values in it also. Like in null dictionary I want the name to be equal to my college. Let's save and run it. so in this dictionary we have some value so sometimes we have code scenarios in which we are starting with an empty dictionary and then we start adding values in it now in dictionaries we are going to talk about nested dictionaries when we read conditional statements in if else we told that if we write any condition in if, we can make another if else block in it. We used to call this nesting. So these were nested conditional statements. Now as we had talked earlier that nesting is not only in conditional statements, it can also be in other data structures. So what can we do to bring nestedness in dictionary? We can make any key's value a dictionary. For example, we have a dictionary called student. We are storing student's value in student. Here we can store the name of our student, let's suppose the name is Rahul Kumar and if we want we can store their subject, so when we will store the subject, because a student can have multiple subjects, so either we can store in the form of a list, that student's subject is physics, second subject is chemistry and in this way. But if I want to store student's marks with subject, how to store them? So for that we can choose that here I want to store key value, that so many marks came in this subject, so many marks came in this subject. So for that we can create one more dictionary here with some curly braces. So we can specify here that what will be physics, our key will will be and we will write our marks in it, then we will write chemistry, we will write marks in chemistry, then we will write math, we will write our marks in math and in this way we will be able to store all our values in the form of a dictionary. So what happened is that we created another dictionary in the dictionary, so this is called nested dictionary. If we want we can print it also. We can print our student. We save and run, so this is the value of our student. And if we want we can print only subjects in the student. If I want to print only subjects in the student, then I have to access the subjects in the student in this way. So all our subjects are here. Now these subjects are a dictionary in itself. And in the dictionary, let's suppose I have to print the marks of chemistry. So what we can do for that is we put another square bracket here. And then we write our one more key. Let's save it and let's run it. So we got the marks of chemistry. So if we have data available in nested form, then we can use this method to take out our relevant information from nested dictionaries. Now next, just like we had studied methods in list, tuples, and strings, similarly we are going to study some special methods of dictionaries. The first one is our dot keys method. That means whatever our dictionary is, if we want to take all the keys, then we can write dot keys for that. So we will get a collection return of all the keys. For example, this is my dictionary. If I want to print all the keys in it, then I can simply write student.keys and in this way save the parenthesis and run it, so what we get is, we get something called dict keys, it means keys of dictionary, so this comes in a list format, how many keys are there in this dictionary, one key is name and one key is subjects. We don't have keys with nested return. All the keys with outer layer will come to us. So, we have name and subjects. Now, this data type is dict keys. If we want, we can convert it in a normal list and in a normal tuple also. For that, we can use type casting. We have seen type casting for string, integer or float to type cast in list we write list and in parenthesis pass our value like if I want to type cast in float then I will simply write float and pass the value inside so here the value is student.keys and we want to type cast in list so we save it and run it so now we have this list in which we have name and subject if we want to find the total number of keys of any dictionary so what we can do is we can print length of student so that the length of dictionary will be which is going to be 2, which is the total number of key value pairs. So, we can do it directly through length or we can also take the length of this list in this way. We have added another layer of length, so we will also get the answer of 2. So, what we are trying to do is, first we have taken out all the keys of the student dictionary and then we have type cast it in the list. Now we are trying to find the length of the final list that we have. So this thing is also possible in Python, that is, in one function, there is another function, in another function, there is a third function. But this concept will be a little difficult to understand now. So if we have not done any other coding language before, then there is no need to worry about it. Our functions chapter will come in which we will understand this thing in complete detail. I am just giving you a little overview in the beginning so that we get a good flavour of using different functions together. The next method which we can use is our values method. With values we have a collection return of all the values in the dictionary. Like here we can simply write dot values. Once if I write dot values, so let's save and run. So this is our first value, the value of the name was Rahul Kumar and this is the dictionary of all our subjects. Here what is the type? Here it is by doing dict values, but if we want we can also convert it in our list. Let's try to convert it in a list. So, our list is made. The first value in the list is a string and the second value is a dictionary in the list. So, one type of data type can be stored in another type of data. We can store a dictionary in the list and a list in the dictionary. So, this way also our data is stored. Next method which we will talk about is dot items method. Dot items returns all the key values of any dictionary as pairs. Like here if I write student dot items. Dot items means basically all pairs will be returned. So we run it. So this is our first pair. How is it coming? It is coming in parentheses. Parentheses means in the form of tuples. So this is our tuple. First value is key in tuple and second value is value. This is our second tuple. In second tuple first its key is coming and then its value is coming which is a complete dictionary in itself. So in this way tuples are returned to us. If we want we can type cast it. First its key is coming and then its value is coming which is a complete dictionary in itself. So this way tuples are returned to us. If we want we can type cast it. We can type cast it to some list. Something like this. Let's save and run it. So we have a proper list. In the list this is our first tuple. This is our second tuple. If we want we can access these tuples individually. Like this is our list of all items. We can name it pairs is equal to this value. And then inside pairs if I want to access first pair. Then I can simply write pairs of 0. Let's run this. What will come in pairs of 0? A tuple will come in which name and value is stored. So name was name Rahul Kumar. In this way we will get first tuple. And if weple and we can print second tuple in pairs of 1. Next method is dot get method, if we pass any key, it should not be double quote, so if we pass any key, this returns us the value of that key. Now there are two ways to return the value. One is that if we have a dictionary D, we have written the value of the key in it. So what will we get in return? We will get the value. Or we can simply write D.get and our key. What will happen with this? Value will be returned. So there are two ways. One is the normal method and the other is the method method. why we need two methods to get value? to understand that, first let's write both of them once. let's suppose, I want to print the name of the student and I can also print student.get name both will give me same values save, run and both have printed the same thing but if by mistake I have written name 2 here and here too, so what will happen in this case so in this case this line returns an error which we have already seen before and this line will not return any error. What will it return? It will simply print the value of none for me. Let's see this line once. This line will not give any error, it will print none. Because this line does not exist, so what will be returned from the method nothing, none means empty but if we use this line then what will it do? it will give us error so what we have here? we have got error so this is the difference when we normally try to access the value with square bracket notation then we get error and we do not get error with method so as a beginner we will feel this thing is very small. So what happened then error came, then no problem, then we will take care or we will not do things like this in which key is wrong. But as a programmer we have to deal with a lot of data, we have to write very long programs and in that case it is very difficult to track, to check that exactly which keys exist in which dictionary. In fact, many times, for example, if we are building a website, we are doing its backend with Python. So, what will happen? In that case, if we are returning data from an external source in the form of a dictionary, then we don't know exactly what keys are there in it, in what way, then we can make a mistake. That thing is completely possible. But what does error mean? I will explain it to you now. In code, if we write some lines like this, which if it is wrong and if there is some error in it, then what will happen in that case? In that case, in our code, which all the statements will be written later, like I will print here, Hi, here I will print Welcome to, here I will print my college and here we will write we are learning coding. I have written 5-6 sample lines like this. Now these lines obviously there is no error in them, I have just printed these things and this way there can be a very long code like the line, then what happens in the program? As soon as we run this program and as soon as we get an error, the code after the error, in which there should be no error, which is the correct code, that also does not execute. And this is a problematic thing by programming. Whenever we work in real life, we work in practical work, we work in companies, then errors keep coming. Problems, errors keep coming, bugs keep coming, but that doesn't mean that our code stops. It means that if any error comes on the website, then the whole website has stopped working. So it won't be a good stable system. So that's why we always prefer in real-time practical scenarios that we don't write this type of code directly, if there is any error, then the correct code below is not running for that definitely we have try catch blocks there are different ways to manage such situations in programming but on a very small level, on a basic level there will be a way to manage this situation that instead of this format if we write code practically in python not the current one, we are just learning, then we will try to use methods in it which are not throwing errors. Even if there is an error throw, we are managing it well. There will be another basic way to explain this, that I will simply write print before and here I write after so this after code will never execute we will save and run before it printed but in output window after print never happened means after error nothing happened so to avoid this situation we have methods so that's why we need methods next let's come to our next method which is my update method now in update method we can pass any additional new dictionary or any key value pair in the form of these curly braces. In which whatever key value pairs will be added in our old dictionary. Now let's see an example of this. For example this is our student dictionary. We want to add its city in this student. So we can simply write student.update. We will update it with some new key value pair. City. We will store the value in city. Let's save it and in fact print it. Save the student. Run it. So what value did the student get? The value of city and Delhi what value came in the student? in the student, the value of city and delhi was extra stored now we want this city delhi to be called a new dictionary we can store it in new dictionary also and if we pass new dictionary here then also same output would come that is changes would happen in original dictionary that new dictionary would be added old one would be updated we could have kept multiple key value pairs in it like city and Delhi or age and here we write 16 save it and run it, so these multiple values are updated in our dictionary and it is updated. Now here, when we are passing a new dictionary, if we add an old key in it, for example, I have added a name here and in name, instead of Rahul Kumar, I have added Neha Kumar. So, in that case, the old value, like the value of the name, will be updated. It is not like that if we pass the same key in the new dictionary, then a new key will be created. Because we have already discussed that duplicate keys are not allowed in dictionaries. So, this value will always be overwritten. And a new duplicate key will be created. So, we have searched the most commonly used dictionary methods. Generally, when we use dictionaries, there will be very rare cases when we have to try to use methods outside of these. But if we have done these well, then I don't think we will face any problem in using any new methods. Because simply we can write a dictionary name and dot something. So these are all different methods which Visual Studio Code is also showing us. So there are very easy methods but the most commonly used we have already covered those which we are seeing in day to day life coding inside Python. Now next data structure or next data type about which we are going to talk they are called sets in Python. Now if we are coming from math background, we studied math in 9th 10th or 11th 12th, then there are sets in Maths. The sets of Python are based on the properties of those sets. The meaning of set in Maths is a collection in which all the unique values are stored. If we are storing numbers, then the numbers are unique. For example, if I have stored 1, 2, 3, 4, then it is not like that. We can store 2 twice. 2 will be stored in our set only once. So this is called set in math. Similarly, in Python set is the collection of unordered items. Like there is no order in dictionary, order means there is no index. Similarly, there is no order in set, there is no index. Any value can come first or later. And each collection in the set must be unique and immutable. All the items in the set are unique. It is not like we have stored a number, a value or a string twice. All the items in the set are immutable. That means we can store numbers, integers, and float. Why? Because the number 1 is not the value of 1 that will change in math and become 2. Or the value of 1 will become 1.777. 1 will always remain 1. Universal is 1. Similarly, if float is 2.9, it will not remain 2.9. It will be 3.14 value. Or if we take the example of string, if we create a string in Python, then it is immutable, there can be no changes in it. Or if we take the example of tuple, then we can store tuple in our set too. Because once we create a tuple, there can be no changes in it. Or if we take the example of boolean, true or false, true will always be true, false will always be false so all these values can be stored in our set but we can't store list in set we can't store dictionary in set why? because both these values are mutable we can change list and dictionary that's why list and dictionary are never stored. These are acceptable values which we have read till now which we can store in our set. Now to create set we simply write nums and like we start dictionary with curly braces same way we start set with curly braces and simply we start writing our values in it. Like if I want to create a set, I can simply write, let's call it a collection. Collection is equal to, what is collection? Collection is a set of mine in which I have stored my 4 values. If we want we can print the collection value or if we want we can print the type of collection. Let's save it and run so this is the value of our collection what is the type of it? it is set equal that is python recognizes it as a valid set in set there are no key values like in dictionary only value is stored if we want we can store our string values in set save and run so what happened? string values also came together in the set. But if we want to store the same value twice, in this way we will store 2 times 3 times, or we will store the world twice, then what does the set do? In that case, the set ignores the duplicate values. There will be no error, only duplicate values will be ignored. That means when we will print the set or use it in our collection then what will come here? World is coming once, hello is coming once, one is coming once, two is coming once. And you will notice an interesting thing, even though I have written world here in the last, it is not like world will come here in the last, world came first. Or if I write 4 randomly, then where did 4 come? This time the set that was printed is completely different. That means 1 to 4 came first, before this 1 to 2 were printed in the middle, here hello and world came together. So that's why we call set as unordered. There is no order, it's not like what we wrote earlier, the thing we wrote in the code earlier will come first, the thing we wrote later will come later. No order of this kind follows. And secondly duplicate values are ignored. In fact, if we want to print length of collection, then length can also be printed. Length will be our total number of items. If we run it by saving, then length will be 5k. What did length do? it ignored duplicate items. Even though we have included 4, 4 plus 3 is 7, 8 items, but only 5 items will come in the final length. Because duplicate values are not allowed in sets. We have to tie this thing together. This is very important. Sets, whether we make it in Python or in any other language like Java, there are always unique values in sets. Now we have seen how to create a set, how to set duplicate or repeated elements, it stores only one thing. Now we know how to create an empty set. If we think that in the set, we will write something like this and create an empty set. So here we should remember that this syntax is a syntax of an empty dictionary. This is not an empty set, this is an empty dictionary. In fact we can also print this if I type, type of collection. What will come? This is a dictionary, this is not a set. So to create an empty set, we have to write set and then parenthesis. So this is the syntax of this method. Syntax means the correct way to write code. So if I want to create an empty set, then we will write this syntax. As we write this thing, this collection will be converted into an empty set. Let's run it. So this time what has come in the class? This time we have set printed in type. Now next we are going to talk about some methods of sets. The first method is add method. Whatever element we write in add gets added in our set. And as it is added, it is a remove method. Whatever that we write in the set are added to the set. And the way it is added, the same way it is a remove method. By removing the set dot, the elements that we write are removed from our set. One thing you have to notice here, an important thing, an important difference. What are sets? Sets are mutable. Mutable means, a new element can be added or removed in a set. But the elements of a set are immutable. There is a difference. Because we read in definitions that each element in the set must be immutable. So in interviews, someone will ask us if a set is mutable or immutable. So we say immutable by mistake. A set is mutable or immutable. So, by mistake, we call it immutable. Set is mutable. It is mutable. It can be changed. That is why we are able to add or remove an element. But we are not able to change the value of the elements. So, that is why set's elements are immutable. So, that is why in.add, we can pass tuple, but we cannot pass list and dictionary. So, set is mutable, but its elements are immutable. Now let's see the methods of set. Let's suppose we created an empty set. This is our empty set collection. Now if we want to add some values in the collection, we print our collection here and start adding some values. Let's suppose I add some value, collection.add1, collection.add value 2 is done. Let's suppose if I write collection.add value 2 again, what will be printed in that case? In that case we will only get 1 and 2, because our set will ignore this duplicate value. Similarly, we can remove values. Like here we remove collection.remove If we remove 1 then only single value will be left in our set which is equal to 2. If we want to remove a value which does not exist in the set like 7 does not exist in the set, like 7 does not exist in the set. So, in that case, we will get an error. It is basically the same key error. Key error means, like in dictionary, key error used to come that the key does not exist. Here, in a way, that value is the key. That is, in the key value pair, the key is the same, the value is the same, that is, our single element. So, that element does not exist exist then we will get an error. Now in our collection we can store different types of values. If we want we can pass a string here. If we want we can pass a tuple here. Like we have a tuple here. But we can't pass a list. Like if we write this much and run then no problem will come we have our set created but similarly if we try to make a list and pass it so what is a list? list can be changed with time new elements can be added or removed as soon as we write this line what will happen in this? error will come let's save it and run what is the error? unhashable type list. That we are trying to add a list which is an unhashable type. Now what does unhashable type mean? I will give you a very small overview. Basically, whatever values are immutable, Immutable means that which cannot be changed. We can add them in the set, there will be no problem. Why? Because a hash value of these values can be formed. Hashing is a specific algorithm in which we change the original value and convert it into something else. For example, if I have a value of 1 and the other value is also 1, then the final hashing value of both will be the same. That is why Python detects them as the same thing. and the other value is 1 so the final hashing value of both will be same so that's why python detects them as same but if we take an example of a list this is my list 1,2 this is another list 1,2 now in this if there is any change in tomorrow 1,2,3 will happen so its hash value will be different so this is a mutable thing now in case of mutation as soon as change will come in original value its hash value will in the original value, then the implementation of our set will be spoiled. So that's why the values that come in the set are hashable values, which means immutable values. Which once the value is assigned to them in their lifetime, like the value assigned to a tuple, it is not possible to change its value in the lifetime of that variable, it is not possible to change its value. So, what will happen then? Its hash value will not change. So, in the same way, our sets are implemented in Python. So, whenever we read this thing as unhashable, unhashable means the values that are changed, mutated, whose hashing value is different later, so in this generally we are talking about our dictionaries or we are talking about our list. Or in fact we are talking about sets also because set is immutable. Next we have another method, clear method which helps to empty set. For example, here if I try to print the length of my set save it and run it length will turn out to be 4 because it has 4 elements 1, 2, then a string comes as 3rd element and then a tuple comes as 4th element now in this if I want to clear this set then we can simply write collection.clear by that our set will be empty and in length next time it will be printed as 0. Let's run it and we will get value of 0. Apart from this we have a pop method in set which removes a random value, any random value is removed and given to us. For which we are going to create a collection. Let's store some random strings in collection. Let's write hello, let's write our college, let's write world, let's write let's suppose coding, we have python. So, this way we have some random values. What we are going to do is, we are going to collection.pop this way. So, when we will run this, we have got a value of our college. So it's not like our college is stored on first index, there is an order in this way. So in random order, our elements can be popped for us. Similarly, if we want to pop one more value, so this time two values have popped, python and hello. It's not like our college is popped for us again. So this time it has picked Python randomly, then it has picked Hello randomly. So these values have popped randomly. Now its practical scenario is that we have a lot of set of unique values from which we want to generate a random value. Next we have two other important methods related to sets. The first one is union method and the second one is Intersection Method. The way sets work in Maths, in Maths too there is Union and Intersection in sets. In the same way, the union and intersection of Python works. Union in sets means that when we take one set and another set and in both the sets, all the total unique values that are created, by combining those values, we create a new set. That means the union method combines both set values and returns a new set. For example, we have a set 1, in set 1 we have values 1, 2 and 3. Then we have another set, set 2, in set 2 we have values 1, 2 and 3. Then we have another set, set 2. In set 2, we have values 3, 4 and 5. So can we visualize that the 1, 2, 3 that we have, 1 will come here, 2 will come here, 3 will come here, and similarly 4 will come here, 5 will come here, and 3 we wrote only once because what is 3? It is common in set 1 and set 2. So what are the total unique values? What values will be there in the final set? It will have values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. It is not like that 3 will come twice in it. So all the duplicate values are counted only single time. So this is called the union of two sets. Similarly, the union works in Python. For example, if we have our set 1, then we have values 1, 2, 3 in set 1. And we also have values 2, 3, 4 in set 2. Or we can work with these values. And if we want to print, what is set 1.union set2 going to be so what should come here? we should get 1, 2, 3 and 4 equal because in this if 2 is repeated twice then it will come once if 3 is repeated twice then it will come once so our answer is going to be 1, 2, 3 and 4 equal now here set1.union set2 returns a new set. It doesn't make any changes in the old sets. That means even after this if we print set1 and set2 then they will return their original values. This was our set1 and this was our set2. So this is how union works in set. And if we talk about intersection apart from that intersection means common elements intersection means that by combining both the sets, the common values will be returned in the form of a new set for example, this set is 1, 2, 3, this set is 2, 3, 4, 5, then what are the common values? Only 3 so their intersection will be equal to 3 similarly, if we have, that is, in the sets, the intersection is the common area, we highlight it from this area. So here we have set 1 which has 1, 2, 3 and set 2 has 2, 3, 4. If I want their intersection, then that intersection is going to be equal to 2 and 3. Which we can print if we want. Execute it and we have values 2 and 3 So we have covered most common methods in sets Next we are going to study some of our practice questions In practice questions, we have to see the question and understand it And after that we have to pause our lecture and try to solve the question If we can't solve the question then we have to see the solution First of if we can't solve the question then it's okay we have to come and see the solution first of all let's talk about the first question store the following word meanings in a python dictionary so the first word is table, for table the first meaning is piece of furniture, second meaning is list of facts and figures second word is cat, for that we have meaning is a small animal so in this way we have to store these two words with their meanings. Now I know if I make a dictionary, then what is cat in it? It is simply a key value pair, cat is a key and this is its value. I don't think there should be any difficulty in storing it. So let's call it a dictionary. This dictionary is going to be, first let's store the meaning of cat, a small animal. We have stored it, there is no problem in it. Now when we will store the meaning of table, then here key is 1 but what are the values? This is value 1 and this is value 2. How to store both the values together? Now in values, we can store the values together in any way. We can store them in the form of a list or in the form of a tuple. Let's opt for a list. Here our word will be table. There are two meanings of table. First meaning will be a piece of furniture and second meaning will be list of facts and and the second meaning we will have is list of facts and figures we will save it and we can print our dictionary save it and run so we have got our proper dictionary this is our first key value pair and this is our second key value pair let's move towards the second question second question is The second question is that we are given a list of subjects for students. We have to assume that we need one classroom for each subject. For example, a subject is Python, so we need one classroom to study Python. We need another classroom to study C++. This is C1, this is classroom 1, this is classroom 2 and so on. We have to tell how many classrooms are needed by all the students. Now subject wise classroom will be there, how many students can come in a classroom, we have to assume this. So we have different students, there are limited students, subjects are given to all of them. We have to tell for all these subjects, how many total we need for all these subjects. First, let's solve it on paper pen. The first subject we have is Python. We need one classroom for Python. So, this student of Python, this student of Python, this student of Python, all of them will come in a single classroom. After that, Java. We will also need one classroom for Java. So, all the students of Java will come in the same class. Then, C++. We will also need one classroom for Java too. So all the students of Java will come in the same class. Then there is C++, we need one classroom for C++ too. All the students of C++ will come there. Then there is JavaScript, we need one classroom for JavaScript too. Then there is C, we need one classroom for C too. How many classrooms do we need in total? 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So we need to know how we can reach this 5 value in python. We have just counted on the paper pen. But logically if we have all this data then how can we find the total number of classrooms. Now if we look carefully then what is the total number of classrooms? Can we say that the number of subjects we have, that number of classrooms we have. The number of unique subjects we have, that number of classrooms we need classrooms as many subjects as we have, as many unique subjects as we have. So can I say that if we store all this data in a set and we take out the length of that set, then whatever the length of that set will be, that is, the count of all the unique values same as the total number of classrooms. So, simply I have to store all the data in the set and then I have to find the length of that set. So, for ourselves, let's create a set or let's call it subjects. In subjects, we will get different different values. One value will come to us, Python, after that we have Java, C++ and finally C. Remember one thing here, this C++ and this C++ will be treated like different strings. For example, if we print our subjects, let's save it and run. What happened here? C++ returned twice. So that's why in sets we have to keep in mind a case, something is written in lower case, something is written in small. And we want to repeat the same thing, so we have to write it again in lower case. Let's delete it and run again. So what we got here? all the individual unique subjects are here. And how many classrooms will we need in total? The length of the subjects. Save and run. We will need 5 classrooms in total to take the classes of all the students. So, in practical scenarios like this, although it is not that practical, but in such scenarios, the properties of the set are useful to us. Let's solve the next question. Next question says, write a program to enter marks of three subjects from the user and store them in a dictionary. Start with an empty dictionary, that is, the dictionary will be completely empty in the beginning. And then one by one we will add the subjects in it. So basically we have to make the subject's name key. If we have chemistry, then we make chemistry key and then write its value. Then we make physics key and then write its marks and this way we will complete our dictionary. First of all, let's take an empty dictionary, let's call it marks. We have initialized it. Now what we are going to do is take input from the user. First of all, let's suppose we take the input of our physics. Or simply here enter physics is fine and we will convert these marks to some integer value. Let's call this value x. Our marks will come in x and here we use which method to add in our dictionary even though vs code suggest us the method but we use update method to update our dictionary we will pass a new key value pair, in key be of our math and these will be of our chemistry. Here we used to write math and this could be chemistry, it could be English, it could be any subject. And in the last we will print our marks dictionary. Let's save it and run. First we have to enter the marks of physics, then we have to enter the marks of math, then we have to enter the marks of chemistry. So this is our complete final dictionary which we have to enter the math marks, then we have to enter the chemistry marks so this is our final dictionary let's move towards the next question next question is, figure out a way to store 9 and 9.0 as separate values in the set you can take help of built in data types first let's understand this question. This question says that in set, I need something in this way that in set 9 and 9.0 I can store both the values. So currently without external data types, let's store these values in a set. For example, we create some set called values. We are creating values. And in this I stored 9 and 9.0, I have stored two values. Now we are going to print this set. So let's print our values, let's run it. What we got? We got only value 9 in the set because python is made in such a way that it treats 9 and 9.0 as same values. Here if it was 9.25 and we run then these would be different values but because 9 and 9.0 are same. Let's take one more example like 8 and 8.0 if we take example. So what will happen in that? 8 will be stored in a single value in the set. Because the hash of 8 and 8.0 which is the comes out, on the basis of which we store the values inside the set, comes out the same. So this is how Python works. We cannot change this. Now here, interestingly, if we save 9 as 9.0 as a string, then it is possible to save both separately. That is, this way we can save both separately. So we have one possible solution. Whenever we have a situation in which we want to save a number and the same number but in floating format, in a set. So, we can save one by making a string. So, both values will be saved properly. Or if it was reverse, like we have a string of 9 but we get a value of 9.0, then in that case 9.0 would come under floating value set and we could have saved integer in the string. We get one possible solution. The second possible solution which we will discuss is that we use built-in data types. For example, what is 9? 9 is an integer. What is 9.0? 9.0 is a floating value. We can't save both as integer and floating values. We can save both as data types. How? We can save pair. We will write float in tuple first and then save 9.0. And another tuple in which there is integer and then 9 value. So our value 1 will be saved and our value 2 will be saved. We can save both in our set. Now listening to key pairs, we might have dictionary in our mind but dictionary is mutable. Dictionary cannot be added in set that's why we can store pairs in tuple so this is another possible solution in which we will make a set named values in which first float in float value is 9.0 and then we will save int, in int value is 9 so in this way we can create a set for ourselves in which this became the first value and this became the second value and in this way it is possible to save 9 and 9.0 separately so there is a possible solution when we save one in the form of strings there is a possible solution when we make pairs in the form of tuples. So I hope that in this chapter we have learned a lot about dictionaries and sets. Which we will implement better in future chapters. There are many methods of dictionary set which we could not explore properly. Why? Because we have not studied the concept of loops. But in the coming chapters we will read loops and functions. We will know finally the type that comes in the class print again and again. What is the meaning of that class or how methods work, how functions work. There are many different things. Now we are going to read more in our Python series but I hope that from today's chapter, whatever topics we have covered, we will have clarity in our mind. You will get the notes again in the description box below to download. That's all for today, see you in the next lecture. Till then keep learning and keep practicing.

# Lecture 5
  Hi everyone and welcome to the complete python series in which today we are going to read our chapter 5 In chapter 5 we will cover loops in detail, for loop, while loop, break, continue, pass, keywords, how all these things work in loops We will cover all these things in detail with a lot of practice questions Now we will read theory concepts, we will write code along with it, we will solve practice questions. Which we can go and see. So let's start with our chapter 5. Hi everyone, and now we are going to start with our chapter 5. In chapter 5, we are going to read the concept of loops in detail. Now, loops in English means something that is being repeated. For example, if we listen to songs on Spotify or on YouTube Music Player, then in songs, there is an option to repeat the same song over and over again, so what do we say that we have put that song on the loop, we are playing it on the loop, the same work is done in programming of loops, loops are used to repeat instructions, there is some work that we want to do set number of times again and again, so for that we can loop that work, for example, we are making a website, now we have a list on the website and we have a data of 1 lakh users in the list. So if we want to send an email to those 1 lakh users, then there will be one way that we use loops there, about which we will talk now, that how loops actually work and the second way will be that we first of all, remove the name of the first user and send him an email, then remove the name of the second user and send him an email, then remove the name of the first user and send him an email, then take out the name of the second user and send him an email, then take out the name of the third user and send him an email. So in this way, we will have to write the same code again and again and again and again for 1 lakh users. So let's understand this through a very simple example. Before starting the loops, we have two types of loops, one is our while loops and one is our for loops in Python. Both are important and in this lecture and we will study both in detail in this lecture. Now first of all we will start with a simple example. For example we have a string hello and we have to print this string 5 times on our screen. So now we will write print in our python print and then we can simply write hello and we will copy paste this same line 5 times. So in this way we will print hello on our screen 5 times. But here if we have to print hello 100 times or if we have to print it 1 lakh times, then how many times we copy paste things in this way. So what is that? It is a tedious process. Whenever we copy paste in this way and write a code of 1 lakh lines, then our file will be filled completely. The readability of our file code, that how easily we are able to understand our code, will be finished. Secondly, what will be the problem? Secondly, the problem will be that we will be doing a tedious work repeatedly. The work which already has a simple method in Python. And what is the simple method? The simple method is loop. In loop, first of all we will read about while loop. How does while loop work? In while loop, we simply write while which is a reserved keyword. We have already talked about reserved keywords. While, we cannot make any variable's name while. While in English means while that till till this condition remains true, till then whatever work is written by putting colon keep repeating that work. How long we have to repeat that work till whatever condition we write here remains true. That means its value is finally evaluated and comes true or equal. For example if I have to print hello 5 times, then we can use while loop. And if we write while true, till the time it is true, then it will always be true. Till then we want to print hello. So how many times will hello be printed? Hello will be printed infinitely. Why? Because till the time true value, true value will always remain true. So how many times will hello be printed here? Hello will always be printed and will never stop. Let's see its example. As soon as I run this code, what is happening? Hello is being printed. There is no stop to it. So that's why we have to kill the terminal. So basically here we take such a condition that at some point it may be false. Otherwise this loop will keep running and and the hello will continue to run on print. So that's why we generally make a count variable or some other variable which we can initialize with 1. So for example, what is our count now? Now our count is 1 and we have to print hello till our count reaches 5 so till the time the count value is less than or equal to 5 what we want to do is to print hello so lets understand this code and see what will happen in this code first we have taken the count value of 1 now count is 1 can we say that 1 is less than or equal to 5 what will it do? it will give true so in that case we will print hello. After that the value of count should increase here, because if count is 1, then count will always be less than equal to 5, so what we will do here is we will increase the value of count by 1, so count will be count plus 1 or what we can say that it can be plus equal to 1. So count will increase from 1. Now count 1 increases to 2. 2 is also less than or equal to 5. So we will print hello again. Then count will increase again to 3. 3 is also less than or equal to 5. So we will print hello again. Count increases to 4. 4 is also less than or equal to 5. So we will print hello again. Then count increases to 5. Is 5 less than or equal to 5, then hello will be printed again. Then count will be increased to 5, 5 is less than or equal to 5? Yes. So again what will happen? We will come to this line and hello will be printed. After that what will be the value of count? 6 will be there. And as soon as the value of count becomes 6, is 6 less than or equal to 5? No. So what will we do? We will come out of the loop. In fact, by printing this much part, if we run the code, then what will be printed of the loop. In fact, if we run this code by printing this much part, then what will we get printed? Hello will be printed 5 times on the screen. And here in the last, if I want to verify what was the value of count in the last, then I know that the value of count that will be printed in the last will be equal to 6. This value is equal to 6. So this is how our loops work. So how does the flow of loops work? First we check the condition then we get the work done. After that there are some updations in our variable or it may be that there are no updations. After that we check the condition again. Till the condition is true, the work will continue. Then condition will be checked again then work will continue. Then condition will be checked again then work will continue. So so in this way in loop, in a circle we keep repeating the same work over and over again and if we ever have to stop that work then it is important to have false of this condition and to have false generally we take some variable and this variable like our count variable we call called iterators. We call them iterators. And to run in the loop, we call this process as iteration. One iteration means we have done loop once. Second iteration means we have done loop second time. Third iteration means we have done loop third time. And the variable with which we have done loop, we call it as iterator. And generally we don't have count variable, we take a small variable We call it I variable, J variable, X variable, Y variable So we start with a small variable If I have to write the same loop in a different way, then I is equal to 1 I becomes Iterator while I is is less than equal to 5, print hello. This loop will also do the same thing. And we will make I plus equal to 1. Let's save it and run it. So here hello has been printed 5 times. In fact let's print some other string here 5 times. So what is this? This is our college written 5 times. Now as we have written the code to print 5 times, the same code will be printed 100 times. What we have to do is simply change the end of the loop. Like if I write 100 instead of 5, then our college will be printed 100 times. You can scroll on the screen and you can see that this is printed 100 times. You can scroll on the screen and you can see that this is printed 100 times. Similarly, if we want, we can also print it as 1 lakh. Save and run. What is this? Our college is printed 1 lakh times on the screen. If we want, we can also print the count. Like this is my iterator, if we print it, then we can print i with our college we can print i, save and run. So what is the last value? 1 lakh. Before that what is 99999, 99998. And where did this counting start? It started with our number 1. So in this way, we can run our loops no matter how many set number of times. In the same way, if I don't want to print any string, what I have to do is, I want to print numbers from 1 to 5. So to print it, what we will do is, simply we will take our iterator, we can start it with 1, we will write while, till the time my iterator value is less than or equal to 5. Till then I have to print my i, i means my number. So first of all i value will be 1, after that we will increase i, then i value will be 2 and it will be printed. Here we will increase i again, then i value will be 3 and then increase again till the time i value is not 6. And in the last, we can print loop ended, we save it and let's run it. So we have 1,2,3,4,5 printed and our loop ended. Now in the same way we can print 5 to 1 i.e. we can run our loop in reverse. How? We can start our loop from 5. Here we have to end, means the largest value, start from there. And condition will be reversed here. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 We have to print all these. So till then we will keep printing till the value of i is greater than or equal to 1. Now it has started from 5, it will be reduced to 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. Till then we have to print till 1. And here we will do minus equal to. So first it was 5, then 4 and in this way our values will be printed. Let's print our values, so we have 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and our loop ended. So in this way our while loop runs in Python. Now when we are seeing while loop for the first time, so may be a little confusing for us and it takes a little time to memorize the syntax and understand the logic, which is completely normal if we are reading a programming language for the first time. But in this lecture we will do so many questions that we will get a strong command on the loops and we will actually start understanding the loops. One more thing in this, like our loops, one is that normal loop and generally in programming all the loops have a stopping condition. If we create an infinite loop, infinite loop means a loop which never stops, like here I write I should be less than 6, so if we are starting from 5 and we are decreasing i by 1 so first 5, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 0, then minus 1, minus 2, in this way and we have put the condition that i should be less than 6 so iterator will always be less than 6 because it started from 5 and now it is decreasing so what happened? it became an infinite loop and infinite loops are very dangerous in real life programming we should never create infinite loop because it halt the programming and execution and infinite loops have no practical use so if we write any loop by mistake then we should double check that we have not created any infinite loop by mistake like if this is a loop, it will work so many times we have to double check that we have not created any infinite loop by mistake. If this is a loop, it will work so many times that our last print statement or whatever work we do after this loop will never be executed. Like if I try to execute it, what are the numbers? They are getting printed in very negative value. They are getting printed, they are getting printed. So generally in real life programming, if there is a website which has infinite loop Then there will be a point when our browser will crash We will not be able to open that browser or that website So we have to avoid this type of situation We should never create infinite loop Next we are going to solve some practice questions So we are going to solve all these questions with our while loop So in each question we will keep on leveling up little by little And we will solve all these questions with our while loop. So in each question we will keep on leveling up and will solve all our questions properly. First question is, print numbers from 1 to 100. Now to print numbers from 1 to 100, we know that we have to start with an iterator. We can start with i. We can start the value of this variable with 1. We will put a loop while condition will be be till the time our i value is less than or equal to 100. Till then I have to print my number i, so first i will be 1, then 2, then 3 and in this way. And what we will do in the last, in the last we have to update i, so plus equal to, every time we will update from 1, that's why numbers will be printed from 1 to 100. So, basically we are going to write this loop in Python. So, let's start with our question 1. There is an iterator, whose start we have done with 1. Till the time i's value is less than or equal to 100, till then we have to print i. And i plus equal to 1. Let it and run, so we have all the numbers printed from 1 to 100 like this, ok whatever questions we are doing with loops if we want we can try to solve them by ourselves, otherwise if we are finding the concept of loops difficult, there is a problem in making logic, So there is no problem, we can solve them together. Let's come to the second question. The second question is that we have to print the numbers from 100 to 1. 100 to 1 means to print the numbers in reverse order. So for that we don't have to do anything, where will the starting be? Because 100 should be printed first, so starting will be of our iterator from 100. And what will be of iterator from 100 and condition will be of 100, 99, 98 so in last one should be printed. How will it be printed? Here stopping, this condition is called stopping condition. I will write here also, this is our stopping condition. What should be stopping condition what should be the stopping condition? that the loop should run till the time i is greater than or equal to 1 and every time we will make i equal to minus 1 lets save and run so this time 1,2,3,4 till 100 we have printed the numbers in reverse order actually by copying this code what we will do is we will repeat it and we will repeat it and write it as question. Let's come to the next question. Next question is, print the multiplication table of a number n. We will be given any number n, whose table we have to print. Now, for example, we take n as 3. I have to print the table of n is equal we take n as 3, I have to print the table of n is equal to 3. So what will be the method of printing it? Now I know first I have to print 3, then 6, then 9, then 12, then 15, then 18, in this way till 30. So if we think what is 3? Can I say 3 is 3 into 1? Can I say 6 is 3 into 2? Can I say 9 is 3 into 3? Can I say 12 is 3 into 4? This is 3 into 5. And in the last, how far do we have to go? 3 into 10. And in this way, here 3 will remain every time, here again 6 will come, 7 will come and so on. So in this way, we print any number's multiplication table. 7 will come and so on. So in this way we print the multiplication table of any number. Now if we are not getting the logic of multiplication table, then it is completely normal. As a first programming language, whenever we learn any language, generally we are learning by looking at the teacher that this is the logic of multiplication in loops. So now I know that any number whose table I have to print in the table, the first value should be that number only and second I have to multiply that number from 1 to 2, then from 3 to 4, then from 5 to 10 so what I can say is that what is the variable here? the condition of the loop depends on a variable value, variable meaning that which can be changed this n is 3, this will never change, 3 will always remain 3, so can 3 have any role in stopping our loop as such there will not be any important role of 3 or n in stopping our loop. From where should the loop run? The loop should run from 1 to 10. First the value should be 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. And in the loop we will do the calculation of n and i. What calculation will we do? n multiplied by i. So if we summarize this, we can basically take a variable i which we will start from 1 and will run a loop which will run from 1 to 10. So till the time i is less than or equal to 10, what do I have to do? Till then I have to print. What do I have to print? Earlier normally we used to print i, that 1 print, 2 print, 3 print, 4 print. But now what do we have to print is, we have to print n multiplied by i. So we will print n multiplied by i and increase i by 1 every time. So this is supposed to be our loop. Let's run this once and see. Let's comment this out. And here we come to our question 3. What we have to do is, we will start with i, i is equal to 1 till the time i value is less than or equal to 10 till then we simply print i and i plus or equal to 1 will be there so what we did is we printed values till 10 and this time we are going to print for now let's print 3xi, we have 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and like this 30 table is printed, if we had written 4 here, then we simply printed table of 4, we did not have to write new code for new number again and again The code of these 4 lines did all the magic Here whatever number we write, its table will be printed For example we don't know table of 17 So what we did is, we printed table of 17 Now here our n is basically this value, we can take input from the user. So n is equal to, this will be an integer number, we take input from the user, enter, number, we do save and run. Now we have to enter number, let's suppose I want to print table of 15, so what we have is table of 15, so we have table of 15. This time if I want to print table of 21, so we have table of 21. So in this way we can print multiplication table of any number just by writing these 4 lines. Let's come to the next question. Next question is, print the elements of the following list using a loop. What is the list here? We have this list. First of all, normally we create this list. Let's comment this out and start with our question 4 we have some numbers in the list and they look like the square of all the numbers 16, 25 36 49, 64 81 and 100 We have some list of numbers Now in this list we have to print all the elements Now there will be one way, we know how to print elements First of all we can print nums of 0 in the list After that we will copy this We can paste this, then we will print nums of 1 Then we will print nums of 2 Then we will print nums of 3 And how much we will print nums of 1, then nums of 2, then nums of 3 and till where we will print this? basically till when we will print this? till when? what is the last index? 0, 1, 2, 3 basically these are 10 numbers so for 10 numbers last index should be 9 or we can say, last index will be length of nums minus 1 what is the length of this entire list? length of nums is going to be 10 and length of nums minus 1 is going to be 9 so last index is length of nums minus 1 so what I be 9 so what is the last index? length of nums minus 1 so what I have to do is, instead of doing this manually we have to do this same thing in the form of a loop now to do this in the form of a loop, first let's see our variable that which value is changing whenever we print a list or a tuple's value then what changes? our index changes, first index is 0, then 1, then 2, then 3 and it always goes to length of list minus 1. Can I say that we have already read all these things in list and tuples. Index starts from 0 and goes to length of list minus 1. So can we say that index is our variable on which our loop will run. So we can make our index variable, we can call it idx, we will start it with 0 and till when we will run the loop? Till the time we will run the loop, till the time our index value is less than equal to let's shift these things a little bit to the right, that is less than equal to my length of list minus 1. Can we say that this condition will be the same? What condition will be there? That the value of index, the last value will be 9, should be less than equal to length of list minus 1, which is also equal to 9. There is one more better way to write this, less than length of list. Means length of list. Length of list is equal to 10. First index will be 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So 9 is less than 10 but in case of 10 it will not work. So from 0 to 9 our loop will run for all the values. So this is the logic of our loop condition and the main thing in the loop is the condition in a way that what final condition will you set when your loop stops. So the loop will start from index, index is equal to 0 and where will it stop? My loop will be going till 9 and what I have to print the list of index. First list of index will be 0, then list of index will be 1 and so on. Let's see this in code. I have taken an index variable, index always starts with 0. We have made a loop till loop till my index value is less than my length of numbers. Till then what we have to do is we have to print or first we will print only index. Let's see which index values we will go to and every time we will do index as plus equal to 1. Let's save it and execute. So we have all the values from 0 to 9. As soon as we reached 10, we came out of the loop. Now what I have to do is print the numbers with the help of this index. So we want to print the numbers of index. Whose value will be first nums of 0, then nums of of 1 then nums of 2 and so on. Let's save and run. So we have 1, 4, 9, 16 and in this way all the list members are printed. In the same way if we have any other list, for example we have written the names of our heroes. First we have Iron Man, then we probably have Thor, then we have Superman, we have Batman and in this way. So what we can do is if I want to print names of all these heroes, then the same logic will be used. Take an index variable, the value of index will start from zero. Take a loop until index value is less than length of heroes, list is at the end and we have to print heroes of index and every time we will do index value plus equal to 1 save it and execute, first iron man came, then thor came, then superman and batman in this way all the elements of our list were printed if we want we can take index as i instead of idx then the variable will be smaller but this loop will work as it is, logic will work as it is so in this way when we go on top of each item list or a tuple, what we call it in programming is to traverse on things. Traverse means to travel. To traverse on any list, tuple, dictionary means to go over it. So whenever I say traverse, it means we are traveling and going over each element. And we are performing some action or simply printing that element. shabd bolu, to uska matlab hota hai travel kar rahe hain aur ek ek element ke upar ham ja rahe hain aur jaake hum ho sakta hai kuch action perform kar rahe hai yaar phir simply usse element ko print karwa rahe hain. Next hum baat karne wale hai ek aur apne last practice question ki, yeh sawal kera hai search for a number x in this tuple using loop, to pehle jo list thi, to tuple ki jagahe hamare paas kya hona chahiye is have parenthesis. So this will be a tuple. In this I have to search an element number. That number can be any number. X can be anything. And we have to search using loops. So whenever we search anything, the simplest way to search is, if I give you a list of many names, I have given you a list of many names, for example, there are many roll numbers written, many names are written, this thing is A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, X, Z, many names are given. search for L. The best way would be to go to the first item and see if it is L or not. Then next item, then next item, then next item, next item, next item, next item and here I got it. So in this way one by one we will go over each item and check if it is equal to my X. Here X is equal to L. So similarly I have to search for my number here. Now before searching let's take an example of a tuple. Let's copy this and in fact we can delete all of these here. Let's take any number and write it in the form of a tuple. This is our tuple. Now first of all let's print all the elements of this tuple. So we will start i is equal to 0, while i is less than length of nums, we will print nums of i and i plus equal to 1. Just like we used to print in list, we will print in tuple. All these items are printed. Let's suppose I have to search for x is equal to 36. For example, I have to search for 36 which also exists in this list. So what I can say is that instead of printing the element every time, we can check whether our element is equal to x. And wherever we find it equal to x, we will print found. Like here, every time this condition will remain the same, update will remain the same, condition will remain the same, initialization will remain the same. What do we call this? This is called initialization. Initialization means the value with which we started. What will be the change? Our work will change. What will be the work? The work will be that if, here we are using conditional statements, if nums of i, means the number which is on the i-th index, if its value is equal to this x, then at that point I have to print found. If we want we can print index also, at index and here we will print the value of i found at index i we will save it and run it so found at index 5 where is 36? this is index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 so this is the value of 36 at index 5 so how will this loop work? in the loop first of all we will go to i is equal to 0 we will check if 1 is equal to 36 it is not equal to 1 so simply we did whether 1 is equal to 36, here it is not equal to 1. So simply we did plus 1. Then we checked whether 4 is equal to 36, it is not equal to 4. Then again we did plus 1. Then we checked whether 9 is equal to 36, it is not equal to 36. So we did not go into if, we did plus 1 again. As soon as we came here, we saw that 36 is equal to 36, then we printed that thing. But still what did we do in the loop, we saw that 36 is equal to 36, so we printed that thing but still what we did in the loop, we did plus 1 again and we went to every index means if I say else, then in else we can print finding and finding will be printed even after getting it like first it is finding till 4-5 indexes then finally 36 is found then it is also searching for the next index if 36 was 2 times, then it would have found printed 2 times if we run it, then it would have found printed 2 times once it got it on index no. 5, 36 second time it got it on index no. 10 so logically we have to understand how the loop is running. Loop will keep running till it gets printed. But after that loop will not stop. How long will the loop run? It will run till the tuple. Till the tuple's length comes, our loop will keep running. So this way our loops work specially all the while loops in Python. So I hope that we have understood the while loop through enough examples. Next up, in the while loop, we will be reading two more important keywords, which are our break and continue keywords. Whenever we use the loops break and continue, we have two important keywords. First of all, let's talk about break keyword. Wherever we write write break keyword in the loop, our loop will terminate there itself. For example, let's create a normal loop. Let's create a small normal loop here which is printing numbers till 5. So, i is equal to 1 to while i is less to 1 to 5. We have to print i. And every time we are increasing i by 1. So this way our loop will run. Now if we write break anywhere. For example we are checking here. Here we have written if i value is 3. So what should we do? We should break it. Simply we have written break like this way which is a reserved keyword. So in loop, first i value will be 1, then 1 will be printed. Then it will increase again and become 2, then 2 will be printed. Then it will become 3, then 3 will be printed. Then it will be checked whether i value is 3. And as soon as i value is 3, our loop will break. That means we will come out of this loop. In fact, here we print end of loop. Numbers will never print till 5 because we have already broken the loop. Let's run it once. We printed 1, 2, 3 and as soon as we reached 3, the loop broke and we came out of the loop. So, this is how our break keyword works. Now, we can use of the loop. So this is how our break keyword works. Now we can use the break keyword here. For example, if we look at our search code in which we were searching for our number x in our tuple. So what was happening in that? We can implement it in this way that as soon as we get our number, we print it out, where and on which index it was found and similarly we will it from this loop. Break means we will come out of the loop and after that no other execution will happen, that is, finding will not be happening on the index after that. So here we will simply print end of loop, we will save it and run, so first it is finding, finding, finding and as soon as it got the number 36, here it is on index number 5, it printed it as it found at index 5 and as it is our end of loop has been printed, what was happening before that, if we had not used this break, then once we got our number, even after that we are searching and getting the second time number, then we are printing and even after that we will keep searching until the tuple is complete, but we don't want the tuple to be complete, we want to get the number once then only we want to get the break, so for such cases we can use break, break has a similar keyword we have, continue, opposite to break it break. What does continue do? It terminates the current iteration, current iteration means the current turn of the loop and then moves towards the next iteration. For example, if we take an example of a simple loop, as we took earlier, I will start from zero again, till I is less than or equal to 5, till then we have to print i and i plus equal to 1. And here we will check that if i is equal to 3, then in that case we will do continue. In fact this print statement, we will shift it to last so what will happen as soon as i value becomes 3 we don't want to print it we will simply do i plus 1 i.e. we want to do i value 4 and continue continue means these two statements will be completely missed and we will come back here so from 0 to 5 all the numbers will be completely missed and we will come back here. So from 0 to 5 all the numbers will be printed, only 3 will not be printed. Let's save it and run it. And we will get 0, 1, 2, 3 is not printed, 4 and 5 are printed. How did this happen? i's value was 0 in the beginning, we checked whether 0 is less than or equal to 5, yes, less than or equal to 5 is true. Then we checked if i is 3? i is not 3. So we printed 0 and made i equal to 1. 1 less than equal to 5? Then we checked again if 1 is equal to 3? No, it is not. So we printed 1 again and made it 2. Then 2 less than equal to 5? True. Then we checked if 2 is equal to 3? No, it is not. So we printed 2 and made i equal to 3. 3 is less than or equal to 5? Yes. 3 is equal to 3? Yes. Then we made i plus 1, i.e. 3 is equal to 4 and i is equal to 4 and continued. To continue means for this iteration, all the steps in the next iteration will be skipped. And again, this i is 4, now we will check for 4, is 4 equal to 5? is 4 equal to 3? No, so we will print 4 here, so in this way the turn to print 3 we skipped that, so basically continue acts as skip, if we want to skip anything in current iteration so where we have written continue, all the things after that will be skipped. So this way continue works. For example if we are printing a lot of numbers from 1 to 10 and what we want is to print odd numbers only for even numbers we want to skip. So we can simply put in condition that as soon as i's value becomes even, for even value what we do is we check i modulo 2 equal to 0 all the even numbers when they are divided by 2 then their remainder is equal to 0 so in that case we will skip and print in all the other cases so all the odd numbers from 1 to 10 will be printed like 1, 3, 5, 7, all of these are odd numbers from 1 to 10. Similarly, I want to print even numbers, so skip the odd numbers, save and run. So all the even numbers are printed. So this is how our break and continue keyword works in Python. Now next we are going to talk about our for loop. For loops are generally used for sequential traversal. Sequential traversal means first one thing is coming then second thing is coming then third thing is coming. In this way when we travel in a sequence. Like when we travel in a list then we will do sequence. First element will come then second will come then third will come. In case of tuple we will travel in sequence. In case of string we will travel in sequence. In case of string, we will travel in sequence. So, we have an index, in a particular sequence, where elements are present. So, for sequential traversal, we use for loops. For example, for traversing a list, string, tuples, etc. For example, we have made a list, and we want to go to all the elements of this list And we don't want to go in the form of index in while loop So we can use for loop, we write for And then we can write any variable here, we can write element, item, value And this in is our keyword Then we write the name of our list And then all the elements of the list come one by one so if we want we can print those elements so the syntax of for loop looks like this, for is a keyword then we take an element in our list and then we perform some work on that item for example let's create a list in which we have some numbers now if I want to print these numbers in for, so we will write for. Now let's write num in list. So what is this list? This is our structure. We call it numbers. Numbers. And we call it value instead of num. So one by one we will go to every value. First our value will be 1, then our value will be 2, then our value will be 3, 4, 5 like this. And we can print our value every time. Let's save it, let's run it. So we will get our numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And similarly if there are no numbers in this list, for example if we have some vegetables, potato, brinjal, we might also have lady finger and cucumber. So in this way we have multiple vegetables. And value in, we just have to change the name of our list. So all the values one by one will come under this value variable which we can print. Save it, run it. All the values will be printed. So in this way our for loop works. Now if we want we can use for loop on top of a tuple also. For example we will create a tuple. We can take any random numbers in the tuple and for number in tuple we have to print our number so we save it and run it so all the numbers will be printed in same sequence so generally if we have to work on any iterator means we have a variable whose value we are updating then we have a stopping condition so we will do all that work with while loop and if we have to traverse on any data type like tuple like list, like string we will do all this with while loop and if we want to traverse on any data type like tuple, list, string then how we will do all that, we will do all that with for loop. Here let's take an example of string, for example we have a string called apna college, so here if I want to put loop for character in string, we want to print it every time, we will save our character and run it, then all the individual characters will be printed in string. Now whenever we use for loop or while loop, along with that we can use an optional else, this is completely optional, using it is not compulsory for us. Using else means that for example we did some work in the loop, if we want to do something after the loop ends, we can do that in an optional else. We can write our loop in this simple way and then we can do our work. For example, we can do our work. For example, all these characters we have printed them. Now after printing these characters, we can print them in else save it and run it. So all the characters are printed and at last we have end printed. Now in this, we may have a question in our mind that why I need this else. For example if we had written this print without else here in the end, then also we would have got the same output. So what is the need of else? We need else in those specific cases where we use break. For example this is our code, we want to search in our string that where does our character o come. So we can search here that wherever the value of our character is equal to o, we will print O found and from there we will break, we have written some code of this type and in all other cases we will keep printing our characters, so in this case if we save and run, then first we went to A, we searched here O does not come, then we went to P, then we went to N, we printed N, went to A, got A printed, went to C, printed N, then A, then C, then finally we got O, we got O, so we printed O found here, and then we broke it with loop, now when we broke it with loop, then what happened in that case, in that case our else was not executed, but here we did not write else, we have just done end, then our end would have been printed. So in whichever case we want that the loop runs till the time something is done, then we can write it in else. That else work will not be executed in break cases, but the work we will do outside will be executed in every case. So that's why we can write such work which we want to complete till the end of the loop in our else. Next, we are going to practice some more questions using for. So to do these two same things, we will use our for loop this time. First of all, let's come to the question. Ok, here we have to pause the lecture once, we have to try to solve the question once by ourselves. So the question is telling us to print the elements of the following list using a loop. Let's make a simple list first. Let's create a list called numbers. Inside this we will have numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 40, 9, 64, 81 and 100. Now what we have to do is, we do is print these numbers in for loop. So first we will write for some element. I have written el, short for element. In numbers. And we will print every element. Let's save and run. All our elements are printed. Next question is, search for a number x in this tuple using loop. So here we take a number x is equal to 36 or this time 49 and we write 49 twice, last time also we write 49. So we are going to every element of numbers, we convert it to a tuple and we will check every time if element, this time we don't have to see index, this time we can directly see the value of our element, if element is equal to x, then we will print number found at index, ok here we can't print index, so what we have index, so for index we have to make a different variable index is equal to 0 and every time we have to make its value plus 1, i.e. index plus equal to 1 although we are not using it in condition as such but still we will create index so that we can track our index. Let's save it. Let's run it. We have found the number at index 6 and index 10. This is my index 6 where I got 49 for the first time. This is my index 10 where I got 49 for the second time. If we go and get the number only once and then quit, then we can use a break statement here. Let's try to run it again. So, number found at index 6. So this way our for loops work with our built in data types. Next we are going to talk about range function. Range is an important function whenever we are using loops. What does range function do? It returns a sequence of numbers. Sequence means it returns a list but not in the form of a list data type. It returns a normal list of numbers. And this sequence always starts from 0 by default and increases by 1 by default. For example, if I write range of 5, then what will be my return? I will get return of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. So, in this way, I will get return of 0 to 4. Where did start happen? Start by default happens from 0. What is step size? Step size means, step size is basically how much you want to increase. Generally, what is our step size? We take plus 1, we increase numbers by plus 1 in loops. So here step size is by default 1. And what is ending condition? Ending condition is where you end before 5. So these are our three variables on which our range function works. Let's see an example of this. For example, I try to print range of 5. As soon as we print this, we will get a print range from 0 to 5. Now if we print range of 5 in this way, then as such numbers will not be printed. But if we want, we can print index. For example, we have made a sequence of range of 5 and in this sequence, numbers have come. How to do it? How to tally? We can print sequence of 0, then we can print sequence of 1, then we can print sequence of 2, then we can print sequence of 3, in this way. So, sequence of 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 3 like this we have different numbers now if we want to run a loop on this sequence how can we do that? we can write for i in sequence print i so what will happen is that all the elements of sequence numbers i will be printed. So we have all the numbers printed from 0 to 4. If we want our sequence to go up to 10, then we can print numbers up to 10, that is from 0 to 9. So our ending condition, the number which is ending is not included. Here instead of saving it in the sequence, what we can do is we can simply write range of 10 here. That too will be completely logical to write and sometimes it is written in syntax like this. Generally if we see the code of Python, then we are working in the same syntax. So what will happen is that all the numbers will be printed for us from 0 to 9. Now there are three ways to write our range function. Like there are 3 different values in range function which we can write. One is our starting value which is optional. Meaning the question mark means optional. That if we don't give starting value then it's okay it will start from 0. One is our stopping value which we have to give compulsorily. And one is our stopping value which we have to give compulsorily and one is our step size step size is also optional, if not given then by default it will start from 1 for example if we make a loop in this way if we write only one number in it then we know that we have sent our stop condition in the range this 10 is my stopping condition but here if I create another loop in which I write 2 to 10 it means I am giving start and stop condition. 2 values means we have given start and we have passed stop. Means this loop will start from 2 and will print values till 10 i.e. till 9. Start is included, stop is not included. We will save it, comment it out. And let's try to execute it. So from 2 to 9 all these numbers are printed. This time 0 is not printed, 1 is also not printed. And if we replicate this same loop and write something like this. So this means first number is start, second number is stop and third number is step size. Step size means how much to increase. So this time start is from 2, so first 2 will be printed then it will increase from 2, so then 4 will be printed. Then it will increase from 2, so 6 will be printed, 8 will be printed. And then it will increase and become 10, so we don't include 10, so from 2 to 8 we will print all the numbers with a step size of 2, we save it and run it, first we will have 2, then 4, then 6, then 8, so in this way, similarly if I want to print all the even numbers from 1 to 10, So how can we do this? We can take here For i in range In fact we can start our range from 2 We want to go till 10 Or take 100, we want to go till 100 So we will print all the even numbers from 2 to 100 And every time we want to increase from 2, we will print i, so all the even numbers from 2 to 100 will be printed for us, we want to include 100 also, so we will simply make it 101, so in the end 100 will also be printed, if we want to print odd numbers, then we will start from 1, save it, let's run it, so all these odd numbers will be printed. So in this way loop is a basic thing but after that make logic that how even numbers will be printed, how odd numbers will be printed, how multiplication table will be printed, how we can search an element, all those things are logical which will actually make us a good programmer. One more thing that I wanted to tell you, the work that we performed to search any number in a tuple or in a list and the method that we used to search the number, in programming we call it linear search. Linear search means we will go over each value and check if it is a value or not, then we will go over the next one and search, this is not the same, go over the next one and search, this is also not the same, go over the next one and search. This process, this way of searching, we call it linear search. Linear means search in a single line. So this is important to know so that we get familiar with the terminology of programming. Next thing we are going to do is some practice questions. We will solve these three practice questions with the help of for and range. First question is print numbers from 1 to 100. So it is going to be very simple. For i in range. We just have to use for loop. We will write 101 here and print our numbers. Ok, this time we have to start with 1, so we will start with 1 and go to 101. So what will happen? Numbers will start with 1 and end with 100. Let's come to the second question, print numbers from 100 to 1. What we have to do for 100 to 1, we can start the loop from 100 and stop it when we reach 0, that is, when we reach 1 and every time we will do minus 1. Minus 1 means we will decrease it by 1 every time. Let's save it and run it. So from where did the loop start? It started from 100 and stopped at 1. So step size can also be negative. If we want to take it in decreasing order, then we can also make the step size negative. On the third question, print the multiplication table of a number n. It is going to be very simple. In fact, if we have understood the while loop and for loop, we can do this by ourselves. If there is any number n, then take input from the user. Enter number. And then for i in range, we have to start from 1 and we want to go till 11. We want to print N multiplied by I. Let's arrange it, save and run. Let's suppose we want to print table of 12, so we have printed the entire table of 12. So this way our code works using range. Next we are going to read one more interesting thing in loops which is my pass statement. Pass means null statement. If we want to write a loop in which we don't have to do anything, but still it is forced for us, we have some situation in the code that we have to write a loop in which we don't have to do anything. So, we use pass statement there. First, let's see why we need the past statement. For example I want to create a loop for i in range 5. I have made a loop like this and I don't want to do anything in it. What I have to do is leave this empty. So can I leave it empty? Let's suppose we print it in the last. Some useful work, after this loop something useful is happening, we will save it and run it, error will come, what error will come, this print statement was expected in an indented block, means here you left this block empty, for loop and after that you are working, so basically python is saying do this work in loop, there should be some work in loop, but we want to do nothing in loop. So for that we can simply write pass here. Pass means skip, but this is different from continue, this means Do nothing in loop. Now if we run, then all things will work perfectly. Now why is the need for pass? Pass is used when we want to write some null statement that does nothing. It is used as a placeholder for future code. For example, we know we have to write some code but we are not writing that code for now. So we will simply write pass there and later we will complete this code or loop. We can also use pass in if-else. For example, if some variable i is greater than 5 then we can write pass here that we don't have to do anything now, we will do it later generally the pass we use in python in exceptions or try catch but for now it is out of our scope because we are just starting to learn our loops but yes there are some practical use cases in which we need pass but we don't use pass so frequently. In general cases we are making loops only when we have some work to do in the loop. Next we are going to solve two more practice questions. First of all, practice question is saying, you must have noticed that we have done more practice questions in the loops chapter. Why? Because loops are a bit complex as a beginner to learn in Python. So, the more practice questions we solve, the more our strong command will be made on loops. The more our logic will be strong. Second thing is that loops are an interesting concept, a difficult concept as a beginner. So, more questions can come out from it. So, that's why I tried to solve a lot of different variety of questions in this lecture so that our understanding can be in our mind that how loops work. First question is write a program to find the sum of first n numbers. Means n natural numbers should be there. From 1 to n. Let's suppose n is equal to 5 so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we have to calculate the sum of all these numbers and print it so for example, let's take n as 5 so to print the sum of all the numbers, first we can make a sum variable. First we will add 1 to sum, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5. So the sum variable will contain the total sum. First we will run a loop to print numbers from 1 to 5 or from 1 to n. i in range of n means we are going to this number's range we can write n plus 1 print i let's save it and run it so from 0 to 5, let's start from 1 so from 1 to 5 all the numbers are printed now I want their sum so all the numbers that have i, let's take a sum variable and we will start it with 0. So in sum we will add our i every time. So in sum first 1 will be added then 2 will be added then 3 will be added. In this way all the numbers will be added. And in the last we will print total sum is equal to sum save it and run total sum is equal to 15 for n what is the sum of 5 numbers in the beginning is 15 what is the sum of 6 numbers 21 is printed 7 numbers in the same way 28 will be printed and in this and we can calculate the sum of total n numbers. The value of n can be anything. This is our first question, now let's come to the second question. The second question says write a program to find the factorial of first n natural numbers. Ok, in the question one more thing was mentioned that we have to solve this question using while loop. So no problem, we will write the same logic with while loop. How will we solve with while loop? These two values will remain same. Let's come here. While, let's take some number i is equal to 1 till the time i is less than or equal to n. Till then what I have to do? Till then I have to add my i in the sum and at last I will print my sum, same code, here we have to update the i also, by mistake I created an infinite loop, if you noticed, in this way we don't have't create infinite loop like this if we run, then total sum will be equal to 28 next question is write a program to find the factorial of first n natural numbers using a for loop what is factorial? we must have read factorial in math, even if we didn't read it, it is not a problem, it is very simple like a sum, we calculate the sum, similarly if I say, for n is equal to 5, I have to calculate 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5, what will we call this? We will call this as factorial. Whose factorial? 5's factorial. Any number's factorial, a factorial of number n is equal to from 1 to n, when we multiply all the numbers so the final value is called factorial of n. This is the meaning of factorial. So factorial of n is equal to 1 will be 1, factorial of n is equal to 2 will be 1 into 2 will be 2 be the factorial of n equal to 3? 3 x 2 is 6. And in the same way what will be n equal to 4? 24. 6 x 4. What will be n equal to 5? I think it will be 120. 24 x 5. So in this way we calculate our factorials. Generally we don't calculate factorials for very big numbers. We generally calculate our factorial factorial till 9 or 8, otherwise the number becomes very big. So to calculate factorial, I simply have to replace this plus with some multiply. So if I multiply here, and let's suppose I have to calculate factorial of 5. So here we will take factorial instead of sum n is equal to 5 factorial is done, from where we will initialize factorial if we initialize factorial from 0 then all the values will be multiplied from 0 and the answer will always be 0 so to calculate factorial, we always initialize the variable from 1 i is equal to 1 here factorial multiply equal to i, i plus 1. So let's do factorial is equal to my factorial variable. Save it. Run it. So factorial is equal to 120. Factorial of 4 will be equal to 24, that will be printed. Factorial of 3 will be equal to 6, that will be printed. So, in this way we can calculate our factorial and print it. This is done through while loop. If I had to do the same thing in for loop, then we would have taken a number n, then a factorial variable, which we initialize with 1. After that, for i in range start with 1 and go to i and end with 1 and we always have to multiply equal to i in factorial and in the last we print factorial is equal to factorial value, let's save it and let's run it, the factorial of 5 turns out to be 120, so in this way we have covered different concepts in loops, all the majority important concepts in python, we have covered all of them in this chapter, solved many different questions and still if we have having doubt in loops then its ok, this same question if you write it yourself and try to understand the logic then we will definitely clear the concept of loops because we don't need to solve more questions than this to understand loops as a beginner, these questions were more than good enough to understand loops in python, so for today that's it, See you all in the next lecture, till then keep learning and keep practicing.

# Lecture 6
 Hi everyone and welcome to the complete Python series in which today we are going to read chapter 6. In chapter 6, first of all we will read the functions in detail, then we will cover recursion in detail. So we will not only read the theory concepts, we will also write a lot of code with it, we will solve a lot of practice questions. let's start with our chapter 6. Hi everyone, and now we are going to start with our chapter 6, in which we will first read about functions. Now function is such a thing, it is such a word which we have heard in the chapters till now but we have not understood what exactly we use it for and why we use it. So when we talk about functions in Python, function is a block of statements, that is a group of statements that perform a specific task. Now earlier we talked about loops, we used loops for the purpose of repeating a set number of times. Now in loops it was fixed that once we write the logic of the loop, if we write that a loop will run from 1 to 10, then it will be running 10 times or 9 times, so it has a set logic that it will perform the same work. But functions are a block of code, meaning a code which we have written once, so we can use it again and again and again, for performing the same work. Now let's see the most basic example of it. For example, this is my python file, and we are given a task to calculate the sum of two numbers. So here we have written our first number a is equal to 5, we have written our second number b is equal to 10 and then we have made a variable sum is equal to a plus b like this and then what we have to do is print that sum. So we have printed it. Now tomorrow it may be possible that we have written a lot of code in between, means this is probably more lines of code. Here we can imagine that 15-16 lines of code came and again we got some other numbers a and b, for which we had to calculate sum. So again what we will do is, we will write a plus b in sum and again we will print sum. And in the same way it may happen that we have to write more lines of code and again we will print the sum. And in this way, it is possible that we have to write more lines of code and again we have to repeat the same logic. Means here A can be 12, this can be 17 and again we are getting A plus B calculated and printing the sum. So in this way, here we have taken a very simple example of calculating A plus B's sum. This is a very simple example. In real world scenarios, there are not so many simple examples. But because we are learning things from the beginner level, we will start with a simple example and then move towards the complex. So here one thing will be confusing us that this code, we have written here also, I had to write the same similar code here here. So, the repeatability in code, what is the code doing? Things are being repeated in the code. Or there is another better word for it, redundant. Redundant means, in English, redundant means something that is being repeated. So, redundant code is a bad sign of a programmer. is repeating, then redundant code is a bad sign of programmer. That again and again the same line of code is written repeatedly in the code. So generally it is advised that if we have to write the same lines of code twice or thrice, then convert it into a function. So basically this work which we have repeated again and again, a better way to do the same work is that we make a function to perform this task. What is the function's work? The function's work is to take two numbers, calculate the sum of both and print the sum. This is the simple work of a function. Now how to create a function to perform the same task? To create a function, first of all we write our keyword. This is def. We can understand it in this way that we are defining our function, defining means when we write word meaning then we define a word, we are telling what our function will do, so we write a keyword def then we can give any name to our function, like we can give any name to the variables, let's suppose we give name to this function calculate, c-a-l-c, calculate sum or underscore sum, I named my function this. After that what do we write in the function? We write parentheses and put colon. In these parentheses, it is possible that we take two values as input. Taking two values as input in the function means that this function takes some value as input and then perform some operation on those values and returns some output. For example, if we make a chart of this and explain it. For example, this is my function. Now we are understanding this conceptually. What does the function do? Ideally, the function takes some input and returns some output. So, the thing that it the input is called a parameter. Like here we have written def as the name of our function, then if it is taking some values as input then it becomes our parameter1, parameter2, in this way it can take multiple parameters. What are the parameters? Basically we have to write the names of the variables. That the calculateSum function will take one value a and one value b A can have any value, B can have any value but here the name of those variables is a and b Now if I want to print sum for a and b then I take some variable sum is equal to a plus b and then I print my sum So what did I do with this part? This part my function performed and gave it Now here the question can come that the function takes input and returns the output. Here my function is not returning any output. But if we wanted we could have returned this sum after printing. If we wanted we could have returned our sum from here. So return also is a keyword in python which is used to send the output back. So function is a block of code, a line of code which takes some input, parameters input and some output returns it. So this is a function, my whole. It took these values as input and outputted this value and in between it performed some work with those values. So this is an entire function to calculate the sum of two numbers. Now how will this help me in my code? it will help me in such a way that this whole part now I don't need to do all this work by removing these lines, what I can simply do is I will call the calculate sum calling means calling, this is not that call, it is a telephone call but as we call someone to do work, for example we hired a chef so what should he cook for us? we have to call him and tell him, similarly we have to perform a function, we have to call him to perform the work so to call we write the name of the function and then pass some values in it these are the values which will be stored in our parameters For example, if there is a in the parameter, then I will write 1 and 2 here. So, 1 will be stored in a and 2 will be stored in b. The same values which are called by the function call, we call an argument in it. This argument is not to fight, but to supply value. These are the arguments which we pass. These are the actual values like pass, these are the actual values like 1, 2, or a string. And this argument is called a parameter in the definition of the function. Now there are many theories, we will revise all of them, so there is no need to worry, we have got many new words. Just focus on learning. Like in calculate sum, now I can pass this value 5 simply and this value 10. So now what I can do by removing this entire code is, I just have to write this single line. Similarly, by removing this entire code, by removing all 4 lines, what I have to do is, I have to write a simple line of calculateSum in which I will first pass the value a is equal to 2 for 2 and then b is equal to 10 for 10. And I can remove this whole code from here to do this whole work, because this work has already been done in the function once so what I will do is, I will call the calculateSum for 12 and 17 so what I did is, I used the same function 3 times number of lines decreased in my code, redundancy decreased and as a programmer this is a better code if I run it by saving it, the work will be the same first the sum of 5 and 10 is calculated as 15 then the sum of 2 and 10 is calculated as 12 and then the sum of 12 and 17 is calculated as 29 so logically the work is the same, we just did our work in less lines of code now this is the practical point of view, why do we use functions? We use functions so that redundancy reduces from our code, which is really important. Means whenever you are doing an interview in a company, it does not just matter that we write the logic correctly, it also matters that how you are writing the code. Forcibly if you have written the same lines repeatedly and them and we are not using the function for that code. That is a sign of a bad programmer. So we don't want to make such mistakes in interviews. So now let's summarize everything. Let's make our new function even simpler. Let's call it calculateSum. What does calculateSum do? It takes two numbers A and B. This should be A. And then what does it do? It takes two numbers, this should be A and then what it does is it returns the sum of A and B. We can write it in this way also, this is also a very simple small function. So whenever we call calculate function, calculateSum, let's suppose we call it with values 1 and 2, what should we have printed? We should have 3 printed. Let's save it, run it. Here what I have to do is, because it is returning the value, whatever value is returned we can store it in a variable and we can print it. We saved it and run it, so what value we got? 3 value. In the same way if I pass it 178 and 221 or 2221 then it will also calculate and print it for me. So our functions work in such a simple way. Now let's revise the terminology in this once because whenever we are like a programmer, we are doing code, we are doing all things then it is also necessary to use the right word in it. Like what is this? This whole function which we have defined and written, we call it in programming as function definition. This is my function definition. In this, what do we call these a and b? We call them parameters. This whole line in which we have written the name of the function and done things like this, we call it function call. And these 1 and 2 values, what do we call them? We call them our arguments. So the value of the arguments is stored in our parameters. Our function can return any value which we can store in a variable and then we can print that value. Now let's make another simple function from this. For example, there is a function that is printing hello. So what we can do is, we write a def function and give the name to this function print hello or print underscore hello. Now to print this function we don't need any values as such. So we can leave our parentheses empty. This function doesn't need any values. So we can leave our parentheses empty. This function doesn't use any parameters. Its only function is to print hello. And whenever we call print hello, it will simply print hello for us. Like this many parts, let's comment out once. Save and run. So what happened? Hello has been printed. And if we write this line 5 times, then we will get 5 hello print in this way, so what functions do we do, same if you have to repeat the work again and again, there is no problem, you just have to make a function. So, the redundancy in the code will decrease. Also, our function has two things that are completely optional. For example, we want to not give any parameter in the function. So, you can make a function without any parameter. And you want that my function will not return any value. Not taking parameter means that no one takes input of my function. You can make such a function also. Not returning means no one gives output of my function. You can make such a function also. Like this hello function, neither it is taking any input, nor it has any parameters, nor it is giving any output, nor it has any return value. So, making such type of functions is also completely possible. Okay, the function which does not return any value, for example, if I print print of hello, what I have done is I have printed print of hello's output. In fact what we will do is we will store it in a variable. Let's suppose this is some output variable, print hello's output is stored and we are printing this output. So, in this output we will get print of none. None is printed because the function which does not return anything in return, in its output automatically none value comes. Now, let's see one more simple example. For example, we want to create a function which calculates the average of 3 numbers. We have to make this function. So, we have to pause here and try to make this function ourselves. Let's see the other solutions also. First of all we will write def and we will give name to this function. Let's call it calculate average and we will get three numbers in it. First number is called A, second is called B and third is called C. In this way. Now what I have to do is give proper indentation and I have to give proper indentation and calculate the average. First we have to calculate the sum. Sum is going to be a plus b plus c and average is going to be sum divided by 3. So either we can print this average or we can return it if we want. So this is our calculate average function. Now let's test it. In calculate average, we will calculate the average of 1, 2 and 3, save and run. So the average of 3 numbers is equal to 2.0. In the same way, let's suppose we take our marks. If someone's marks are 98, 97, 95, we come to this ratio. What is going to be the average? Average is 96.66. So in this way we can write a function to perform our calculations normally. Now all the work can be done in functions which we were writing in the file normally till now. For example, you have to do here that if A becomes 0, then what to do in that case? So we can also put IF, we can also put loops in the function but all the work will be done with proper indentation means we are going to do it with proper spacing. Now next let's talk about the types of functions. Python has two types of functions, one is built-in functions and other is user defined functions. Built-in functions are already written in Python, their logic is also written and we have also used many built-in functions. functions are already written in python, their logic is also written and many of these built in functions we have also used. For example, if I want to print something, what will I do? I will write print apna college. What is this print? This print is a function. If you look carefully, this is a function call which we have written from the first class. Print is the name of our built in function. We have written parenthesis and this apna college we are passing is nothing, it is an argument, it is stored in the definition of the print function. Like if we hover, then I can see the proper definition here in Visual Studio Code, def print, after that some values are coming and after that we have some more parameters. Like we are getting to know here in the print function, one comes that which value we want to print, after that we have two more parameters, one is to print which value we want to print. After that we have two more parameters, one is Sep, this is our separator. And one is End, what should come in our ending. Like here Sep means if you have written multiple values with comma, then there will be a space between two values. Ending means that if we print two values once, then next time when it will be printed, there will be a gap of next line. These things are already defined in print function. We can test this too. For example, I want to print my college and then I want to print Shraddha Khapra. And here I don't give any gap. Still, what will the print function do? Automatically, because what happens in this? Sep is automatically defined to be a space. What is separator? There will be space between both automatically. This extra space is there because it is written in the definition of the defined function. Or if I print both in different lines for example I want to print Shraddha Khapra here then automatically what will happen is that end is defined as backslash end backslash end means next line, I save both the values will come on the next line if I want to print both the values on the same line then what will I have to do? I will have to pass any other value of my ending parameter. Like here I can pass an ending parameter is equal to space. After printing this I just need space, I don't need next line. So both values will be printed on same line. What happened? Both values are printed on same line. So if you want to print multiple on the same line. What happened? Both the things are printed on the same line. So, if you want to print multiple values on the same line, simply in your print statement, in print function, what you have to pass is, end is equal to, pass space, instead of space if we pass dollar, then dollar of output will come in between. So, in this way we can pass anything. This is supposed to be my ending. Similarly, we can do experimentation with the value of separator. So, this is a to be my ending, in the same way we can experiment with the value of our separator. So this is a built-in function. Sometimes there are many normal things in programming which we are using but they are very interesting from inside. They are actually using concepts which we have not studied yet and that is the good and interesting part about coding. So this is our print function, apart from this there are many other functions which are inbuilt. Like we have come to learn the length function, it gives us the length of tuple, string, list. This is a built in function, it is defined from the beginning. Like if I write length of something, I can hover over this and what is this? This is already defined and what does it return? It returns an integer value, returns the number of items in a container. Apart from this we have type function, we have range function which we have already read. If I write range like this, if we hover then it will also get its definition. Range its parameters are also defined, first it takes start, then it takes stop, then it takes step. So in this way it also works on different different values. The second is our user defined function. The functions which our user defined function. The functions we write or any other programmer is writing, which are not inbuilt, we cannot use them automatically in Python. Like there is a print function, a range function, we did not write their logic, someone else had written it. So the functions that the programmer writes, we write, we will write, we call them user defined. And those which are already in Python, we call them built-in those which are already in python we call them built in functions. Next we are going to talk about default parameters. For example, we have made a normal function to calculate the multiplication of two numbers. Definition, we call it calculate or we call it calculate product of two numbers. It takes A and B two numbers and what it returns? It returns A multiplied by B. Now let's suppose in my imaginary world I have to calculate the product of two numbers but I want to pass only A number out of it. It is my wish. Or I don't want to pass any number in it. Then I want to see that print A into B and then I have to return something. And then I calculate product then I want to call this function without passing any argument of its own value. But as soon as I try to do this, it will throw me an error. What is the error? That there are two required arguments in calculate prod which are missing. Here there should have been two arguments which are stored in A and B, so there was an error. But if we want that even if no argument is passed then also function can be run then we can give some default values to our parameters default values means values which will be used only when no argument is passed so here if I write b is equal to 1 and a is equal to 1 so by default if I don't pass anything then it will assume 1 and 1 value of a and b. We will save and run. So this time it will print 1 multiplied by 1 is equal to 1. If I had written 2 here and 4 here and run it again then by default it will print 8. If we want we can make a single value, like I have written b is equal to 2 and if I only pass 1 here, then 1 into 2 will be calculated if we pass 1, then 1 will be stored in A and B's value will automatically be 2 so we will have a return of 2 in the output but we cannot do the opposite like here I have written 2 and here I will leave B empty if I try to do this, it will throw me an error non-default argument follows default argument. Means, first non-default should always come and default arguments should come at last. It is not like we wrote default arguments first. This value, means if A is with default argument, with default value then A will always come later. So whenever we have to start giving default values, we start giving default values from last. So this way our default parameters work in Python. Next, we are going to solve some practice questions to solidify our understanding. Basically, we have covered all the important things about functions, the basic syntax, the rules of programming. This is all there is in functions to solidify our understanding. Now we have to write maximum functions so that we get used to writing functions. Like in loops also, the more loops we write, the more conditional statements we write, the more we will get used to it. So first of all, let's solve with the question. Write a function to print the length of a list. List is the parameter. So for example we have this list let's call it numbers or let's take cities. We have Delhi, we have Gurgaon, we have let's say Noida, we have Pune and we also have Mumbai, Chennai. So in this way we have multiple cities. I have to make a function which can print the length of these cities. Now we know the length of cities, we can print it directly. I just have to print this value in the function. So what I can do is I can define a function. Let's call it printLength. In printLength we can pass our list of cities. Or we can pass any list. And then we have to print length of cities or instead of cities any list can be there in it. Let's call it our list. So whatever list we will pass in it, it will print its length. This is a simple function. Let's make another list. Let's call the second second list heroes, in heroes we can have Thor, Iron man, Captain America, we can also have Shaktimaan, so what happened here, this is our list of heroes, first of all we will call print length, for cities, then we will call print length for our heroes list save and run, cities length is 6 and equal definitely because here 6 is the name of cities and heroes length is 4 and equal so this is our casual and normal function which can print the length of any list next question is write a function to print the elements of a list in a single line. Now in a single line, let's suppose this is my list, let's take the list of heroes. In the list of heroes, if I try to print heroes of 0, what will it do? It will print heroes of 0 for us and after that if I try to write heroes of 1, I know if I write print again and again in this way, then all the things will be printed on the next line, but what I want is to print on the same line, so we had learned the logic of its funda, what is the logic, we can simply change our end, what is end, end backslash n, if we write end backslash n here also, then what will happen? Next line will have the same effect. In one line, in one line. But if I space here, then it will not come in the same line. Like in one line, space, iron man, space, then 6. So I have to write the same logic in the function. If we don't call the function, then there is no difference in the function, we can write many functions in this way, they don't make any print or work. Like here I can create my second function, which will print the list, print my list, any list can be in the function and here we can run a loop for our list for item in list print my item with ending of space this is my function which will print all the items in single line for me. I have defined the function first, passed an argument in it after that I have given proper indentation then I have put a for loop to iterate on the list then again I have given indentation, proper indentation is necessary and then I have printed the items. So, the knowledge of all the functions, the knowledge of all the print functions built-in functions, the knowledge of all the loops logically the knowledge of print function, built in function, loops, list. Now the basic knowledge we took in the first 5 chapters, we are combining all that in this chapter. If you look at it that way, then you will get to know how many small things are combined and how complex programs can be built on complex on complex. Although this is not a very complex program, but slowly we are moving in that direction. We will save it and I can call this print list function for my heroes. I saved and run and all the heroes are printed in the end we have given space So if we want We can give an extra print here Or not here If we want we can give an extra print here So what will happen is that this time this percentage sign will not come for us So that is basically kind of like a trailing character But for now we can ignore it if we want If we want we can print our cities also in the same way save it, run it all the cities are printed for us next question write a function to find the factorial of n n is the parameter first of all let's revise the factorial in math n factorial means this percentage sign is used for factorial in math. That we multiply all the numbers from 1 to n. 1 x 2 x this way. For example, 4 factorial means 1 x 2 x 3 x 4. 3 factorial means 1 x 2 x 3. So this way we can calculate the factorial. Now normally we have calculated the factorial from the loop. Let's remove this part. And let's suppose we have a number n, n is equal to 5. I want to calculate n factorial. I know n factorial is equal to 120. Now let's see how we will calculate. We can run a loop for i in range. What I have to do is go from 1 to n. So we can start from 1 and go to loop n plus 1. And every time we will make a factorial variable. Every time I have to multiply my i in factorial. And in the last we can print our factorial. So we will have 120 printed. This was our logic, we have already covered it in the last class. So 120 will be printed for me. I just have to shift this logic in a function. Let's cut it. Let's define a function. It is called calculate factorial in which any number n will come. Now what we will do is first we will make factorial a variable. Then we will run the loop. Then we will calculate the factorial value in the loop and then print the factorial. If we want we can also return it if we want now I can call this calculate factorial function for my number 5 let's save it and run it so 120 is here calculate for 6 so we have 720 so in this way for multiple values we can directly calculate their factorial through this function now let's come to the next question write a function to convert for these values we can calculate their factorial directly through this function. Now let's come to the next question. Write a function to convert USD to INR. What will happen to me? I will be given a value in American dollars. For example, I am given $1. I have to convert this value, the value of USD to INR, in Indian rupees. Currently, the conversion rate that 83, so 1 dollar is equal to 83 rupees, so we simply have to multiply whatever value we get from 83. For example, if we are given 1 USD, it is equal to 83 INR, if USD is given then it will be equal to 166 INR and so on this way we can continue our multiplication so let's make a function let's call it def, let's call it converter what will we get inside converter inside converter we will get USD value and the USD value we have to convert it into INR so what we will get USD value in converter and we have to convert the USD value in INR so what we will do is we will print it. First let's write our USD value, USD value is equal to INR value, in fact we will calculate here INR value is equal to USD value multiplied by 83 for today and here we will use our INR value with INR we will save it, I hope you understood this whatever value is coming in dollars we are multiplying it with 83 and printing it here. Here we can call our converter in which let's suppose I passed $1 in the beginning. It is printing 1 USD is equal to 83 INR. Let's suppose I want to print $100. $100 is equal to 8300 INR. Here I want to print $73 which I think is difficult to calculate in our mind but it will be equal to 6059 INR. So we have made a converter function which is making our work very easy for us. So in this way there are different functions which we have written and seen which I hope will give us some habit of writing functions. Functions are very simple, in fact, I find the logic of functions easier than the logic of loops because we still have to think about what is going to be the stopping condition, how to update the variable, but we have to simply define what will come as input in functions, what will come as output, rest the syntax of defining the function is very easy. In Python, the same things are there, maximum things are easy. So I hope that we have understood the function till now. Let me give you a homework problem here. You have to write a function which will take an input of a number. Means your function should have a number in its input. And what should your function do? If that number is odd, then in that case a string should return odd. And if that number is even, then the output of your function should be a string output saying even. What you have to do is write this function in the homework problem, it will take any number input, if the number was odd in the output, then it will send odd string and return it and if the number was even, it will return even string. If you are able to write it, it means you have understood the logic of the functions properly and now you are ready to write your functions. Now next we are going to talk about an important concept related to functions, which we call recursion in programming. Now before reading recursion, a small warning that it is possible that we may not understand recursion as a topic completely for the first time and it is possible that we have to repeat the explanation once, twice, three times, which is completely normal because whenever we are learning any language, whether it is Python, Java, C++ or JavaScript, whenever we are looking at recursion, then when the first time recursion hits us, then we have a little difficulty in understanding it as a beginner, especially if Python is our first programming language. So, a little things can happen, we have to repeat it and try to understand it slowly by pausing it, which is completely normal. Everyone who is a good programmer, who is coding well today, had the same situation with him. So if it is coming with you, then that is perfectly fine. So we are going to understand the concept of recursion by taking an overview in this chapter. Recursion is a concept in which basically a function calls itself repeatedly. We have seen that we have written a normal program till now, in which there is a function in between. Now, generally what happens is, generally there is a calling statement in our program which calls this function and makes us do some work. Now, what happens in recursion? In recursion, there is a normal program, there is a normal function. But the calling statement, in a way, this function is calling itself. After that, it calls again, so it is calling itself again, calling itself again, calling itself again. So this situation is like loops. What do we do in loops? In loops, there is a block of statement which is repeating and working again, repeating and working again, repeating and working again. So functions also work like loops, only calling statement. Also, if I speak in very plain language, then what is recursion? It is a dangerous version of loops. It means, in maximum cases, we may not need recursion, we may not need to write recursion. But there are some specific cases where if we write the same code with loops, it becomes easy to write the same code in recursion. But the easy codes, the easy things, we generally prefer to write them in loops. Another interesting thing here is that all the work we do in loops can be done in recursion. And all the work that can be done in recursion can be done with loops as well. So loops and recursion are interrelated in a way, we can do the same work with both. In some cases we prefer loops which are generally the beginner level codes. And later if you want to learn data structures algorithm or something else, then there will be some specific cases in which recursion will give you simple code as compared to loops. So now let's understand in detail what exactly is recursion. We have talked about this that recursion is a function when the function starts calling itself. For example, let's create a function which is printing any number. We call this function show. It's called show which is showing any number. If any number comes in it, N. So what is it doing? It is printing that number N. We have made such a simple function. And we are calling for show. Let's suppose, let's call it for show 5. So what will it do? It will give us 5 by showing. It is such a simple function. Now there is no recursion in it. Now let's suppose, what I have to do is I have to first show 5 what I have to do, first I have to do 5 show, then I have to print 4, then I have to print 3, then I have to print 2, then I have to print 1 and I want to print all these in the same function call, that is, I want to call the show only once and the show prints all the numbers for me. Now I know the easiest way would be to run a loop that goes from 5 to 1 but I have to use recursion here. So the logic of using recursion would be that first see what is being performed. First what we are doing is whatever number n is coming to us, this number n. First we want to print that n, then we want to print n-1, then we want to print n-2, then we want to print n-3. How much do we want to print n-2, then we want to print n-3, how far do we want to print until we reach 1. So the first way to write recursion is to write the work in recursion. That what work should the function perform. The function basically has to print the value of n. So we have already written the work. After that we have printed n, that means first I printed 5, then I have to print 4. Can I say that 4 is N-1, 3 is N-2, 2 is N-3 and in this way. So once I printed 5, then I can call show to print N-1. i.e. first show called for N, then show called for N-1. First show call for n then show call for n-1 then when show call for n-1 will happen, then what will be the value of n? It will be 4. So basically we get to see this type of code that first we called show for n is equal to 5 then what did it do? It printed 5. And then it called show for n is equal to 4 that is n minus 1 it printed 4 then it called show for n is equal to 3 and printed 3 then it called show for n is equal to 2 and it printed 2 then it called show for n is equal to 2 and it printed 2. Then in the same way it called show for n is equal to 1 and it printed 1. What will it do? Continuously for 0, minus 1, minus 2 it will keep calling in this way. We want that at some point calls stop. We want that as soon as we hit 1, we print 1 or as soon as we hit 0, we print 1. Or as soon as we hit 0, we return without printing anything. Now we have to go back. Where do we have to go back? As soon as we come to n is equal to 0, go back here, then go back here, then go back here. So, we go back level wise. So, here what will I do? As soon as our value n is equal to 0 will hit, we will simply return. When we don't send any value with return, it means we are returning control. We are not returning any value as such. So from here we will simply return. Otherwise, first we will call for 5, then we will print 4, then 3, 2, 1 in this way. So now if I try to run this function what will I get? I will get 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and what has become? This has become recursion and what will we call this function? We will call this function as recursive function. Recursive function in which recursion is happening. How is this recursion happening? This function is called show and in this function's name is show and in this function it is calling show function again but show function we cannot call it infinitely like this, we have to give a condition in the at the end function on which we can return and this condition on which we return this is called base case like in loops there is stopping condition for example I wrote while loop we call it base case like in loops there is a stopping condition for example I wrote while loop so after while we write this condition it decides whether the loop should run or not similarly in recursion there is base case which decides whether the recursion should stop here or not so we call it base case base case here will be when recursion stops when the value of n becomes 0. Otherwise keep printing. Similarly, if I had written minus 1 in base case, then 0 would have also been printed. So all the values from 5 to 0 are printed. So how did recursion actually work? Let's try to understand it for n is equal to 3. In programming There is something called a call stack Call stack means call means function calls Stack means Stack means if we keep a lot of books on one A lot of magazines, we call that stack of books So when we call another function on one function Then we call third function, then fourth function, then a third, then a fourth function, this is called call stack. Whenever a function is inside Python, this is a bit complex, I am explaining it to you, to understand recursion, it is not necessary to know about call stack, but I am trying to explain it to you in complete detail. Whenever we code inside Python or any other programming language, and we are writing functions, internally, for functions call stack is created in memory. If I have to imagine call stack like we have imagined computer memory for variables. If I want to imagine call stack then we can imagine it like a glass or like a bucket. This is our call stack. Now when we call a function, for example I called show for n is equal to 3. So show function will take place in the stack. Let's assume book will make a layer. This will be a layer of show is equal to 3 for n is equal to 3. And all the related variables of its function will be stored in it. It has taken a place in memory. One is that variable takes place normally and function takes place like this. So here if I had made a variable for example a is equal to 1, 2, 3. So my variable a is equal to 1, 2, 3 is stored in the function here like this but I haven't made any such function yet so when show is called for 3 then a layer is reserved in the call stack and now all the functions will be here what are the functions performing first we are checking first, is it n0, no so we don't return then it says print n so if we print n then 3 will be printed for us after that it will call show for n-1 so on this stack on this same pot another layer will be created which will come for this new function for this new call so this is the second call and this call is for show n-1 so here n value will be equal to 2 so this is second layer now as we come to second layer so function starts from new series so it starts from here so again check is it equal to n0? no so print n n is printed here 2 is equal after that we we did, we called the show for n-1, means we will call the show for 1 for the third time, so a third layer will be created of the function, third layer is created in which n value is equal to 1, so function will start again from the new series, now n value is equal to 1, so now we will check whether n is 0 or not. So print n. I printed n so 1 is printed here. Why is 1 printed for n? Because for this function call n is equal to 1. Then again show will be called for n-1. What is n? It is equal to 1 so this time we will call show for value 0. As soon as we come to 0, new function will start and layer will be created and in this last layer value of n is 0 so first check if value of n is 0 yes it is, so return return means this upper layer will be deleted this layer will be deleted and we will come back to this lower layer so what we will do we will delete this layer will be deleted and we will come back to the lower layer we will delete this layer and come back to the lower layer now is there any work left to perform in this layer? n is equal to 1 layer had only one work print 1, it had printed it we had put a call for 0, now no work is left now delete this layer too now this layer will also be deleted and we will come back again but if there was any work for example if I had to print one more thing here end so first 3,2,1 would have been printed then from 0 layer when we would have come back to 1 layer because it was end, so end would have been printed then from 1 to 2 layer, so end would have been printed then from 2 to 3 layer, so end would have been printed like if I try to save it and run then first 3 to 1 is printed now because there was more work left in the old layer then end was printed then this layer moved from here and it said let's go to the old layer so it came back to the n is equal to 2 layer n is equal to 2 layer did this much work now what is left for it to print the end do? Print the end. So it printed the end. Then this layer also worked. So we delete this layer and we go to the bottom layer. In bottom most layer, what is n is equal to 3? n is equal to 3 did this much work. Now for that the end work is left. So what did it do? It printed its end at last. And from here, what happened to call stack, call stack got completely empty, so as call stack got empty means our program got complete, so this way our recursion works, now the functioning of call stack we will not understand it in first time, so if you think you understood it then also repeat it once, because this concept of recursion is very important in programming and if we understand it well from now on then we will get a lot of help if we are trying to learn some complex things in the future. So this is how recursion works in programming. Now in recursion if we remove this base case for example if I comment out this base case then what will recursion do? Like loop could run infinitely here recursion can also run infinitely. And if the recursion runs infinitely, then at a point, there will be a point when it will occupy the whole memory and your code will crash. For example, if I try to save it and run, maximum recursion depth exceeded. That means the depth exceeded in the recursion so quickly that the program stopped automatically. So that's why base case is very important in recursion. How do we write recursive code in recursion? We see our work, what work do I have to do. After that we see what should be my base case. Also generally in maximum cases we will not use recursion. There are specific use cases in which we write. In general cases, we will not use recursion. There are specific use cases of recursion in which we write In general cases, we are completing our work using loops. Now we are going to understand one more example of recursion. We will understand recursion through factorial. We already know factorial. We know n factorial is equal to 1 into 2 into into n minus 1 into n. This is how factorial works. So can I say that we can write 4 factorial as 1 into 2 into 3 into 4. We can write 3 factorial as 1 into 2 into 3. We can write 2 factorial as 1 into 2. This way. There is no factorial of negative numbers. 0 factorial is by default 1 and 1 factorial is also by default 1. These are our default values so we keep them aside. If we imagine factorial in this way, Can I say that 3 factorial is nothing but 2 factorial into 3? Because what is 1 into 2? It is 2 factorial. So 3 factorial is equal to 2 factorial into 3 because what is 1 into 2? it is 2 factorial so 3 factorial is equal to 2 factorial into 3 similarly 4 factorial is nothing but 3 factorial into 4 this value is equal to 3 factorial so can I say that n factorial is equal to n minus 1 factorial into n this statement is completely true in math 5! test on 5 I am saying 5! is equal to 4!x5 is this true? yes it is 4! is equal to 1x2x3x4 we will multiply this with 5 I have got the value of 5! this type of relationship is called recursive relationship means this thing that came out this is how we know that we can apply recursion here why? because the big value is depending on its own small version in technical terms it is called recurrence relation but we will not go into so much detail you can go and read yourself what is recurrence relation in algorithms. If you have Python as a subject or Data Structures and Algorithms as a subject in college, then you will get the details of what is recurrence relation. Where recurrence relation is made, there recursion can be written. This is a recurrence relation. Recurrence means a thing which is reoccurring, which is repeating again. So the small version of a big thing is repeating, that's why recursion can be used here. Now how will we use recursion in programming? Basically in our code, can I say that if I have any function in which I have to calculate the factorial of n, then basically to calculate the factorial of n, we will first calculate the factorial of n-1 in our code. So this relation we have drawn, we can write this same thing that if I want to calculate the factorial of n anywhere, then first calculate the factorial of n-1, then multiply it by n. If I want to calculate the factorial of n-1 anywhere, then first calculate the factorial of n-2 and then multiply it with n or n-1. In this way we can use recurrence in factorial. So we will make a function in which we have to calculate factorial of n. So basically we will first calculate factorial of n-1 and then multiply it with N so if I want to convert this relation to code then I can simply write there is a factorial function in which any number N will come so to calculate factorial of N, I will first calculate factorial of N-1 then I will multiply it with N and this final value that will come, we will return it this is our code now in this code, suppose I have called for factorial of 4. Let's imagine I have called for factorial of 4. So, what will factorial of 4 do? First it will calculate factorial of 3. Then it will calculate factorial of 2. Then it will calculate factorial of 1 then it will calculate first factorial of 0 then it will come to factorial of minus 1 because there is nothing to stop now so we have seen the work what to do but base case is also very important base case means stopping condition of recursion should be stop where 1 or 0 comes. We already know that if the value of n becomes 1 or 0, then stop. In this case, I already know the value of factorial. If the value of factorial is equal to 1, then return the value of factorial. When the value of factorial returns to 1, then it will be 1. Then the value of this factorial. When factorial of 1 returns here, then it will be 1 only. Then factorial of 2 will be calculated. So in this way, this is my base case and this is my final value. So this is my recursive code for writing factorial. Now if I want to calculate factorial of 2, then we can do it. This is going to be, ok we have to print it also. Let's print it here. This will be equalk equal, in the same way it will be 4, 24k equal and in the same way 5 will be 120k equal 6 will be 720k equal in this way, now how did this calculation happen? let's understand it a little more. If we understood the call stack properly, then we would have started to get some clarity in our mind. How are things working? Things are working in such a way that if we put a call for factorial of 4, so this was our call stack, first a layer of factorial of 4 was made. Factorial of 4 said first calculate factorial of 3 for me. So another layer was made of factorial of 3. Factorial of 3 said first calculate factorial of 2 for me. So another layer was made of factorial of 2. Factorial of 2 said first calculate factorial of 1 for me. So another layer was made of factorial of 1. So another layer became of factorial of 1. Now as soon as we reached factorial of 1, for factorial of 1 we saw that n is equal to 1, so it said return 1 from here. So we came to previous layer, what return? By returning value 1. What will it do? It will move from here. What will the 2 layer do? 2 layer will say that factorial of 1 came to me which is equal to 1, with this I multiply 2. So 1 into 2 will be 2, so it will send the old layer 2. So factorial of 2 will be 2 and these layers will be removed. Now what will the factorial of 3 layer say? Factorial of 2 is here, which is equal to 2. So what should I do? I will return 2 multiplied by 3. So this layer will return 6 and will move away from here. Now what is in factorial of 4? In factorial of 4, factorial of 3 returns 6. So its work is to multiply itself by 6, that is to multiply 4. So what will it return? It will return the main function 6x4, which is 24 so when we print factorial of 4, the final value turns out to be 24 so I have tried my best to give you an understanding in the deep, not just an overview I will actually tell you how recursion works because this is an important concept and many students quit after seeing the recursion thinking that what a difficult thing is but it is not difficult there is a cousin of loops who has come and this cousin is difficult to read the personality in the beginning but the more you get to understand him or the more you get to understand her the more you will feel good things are simple, before it was complex but the more you use it, although we are not going to use it much now, so it is not a matter to take tension, in the next chapters we will not get to see the recursion that much, but still we have read it in case you want to learn it later from DSA using python. Now next we are going to solve our two practice questions, so of all we have to pause and try to solve it ourselves. But if you are not able to solve it then it is not a problem because these are recursion questions. And they are going to be difficult for a beginner to solve. So no problem, we will solve them in the class. First question is, write a recursive function to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers. First of all write a function print the first n natural numbers. So any function which has value n in it, what it will do is, it will print all the values from n to 1. We will write such a function. So def, we will give the name to this function, calculateSum, but it will also print it. So what is the work? The work is to print, so print n. Then what to do? Call to print n-1. So I called calculateSum for 5. So it will print. Ok, we forgot the important thing, base case. What is base case here? As soon as n value becomes 0, now 0 is not a natural number so return from here save and run so 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 are printed for me now what I have to do these things are printed now the work is not to print now the work is to calculate the sum so how to calculate the sum basically first you tell this function that it has calculated the sum of n minus 1 numbers for us what we will do in this we will add n only. If the sum of all numbers is calculated till 4, then add 5. If the sum of all numbers is calculated till 3, then add 4. This function says that if I want to calculate sum of 5, then first calculate sum of 4 and add 5 to it. If we want to calculate sum of 4, first calculate sum of 3 and add 4 to it. For sum of 3, calculate sum of 2 and add 3 to it. This is how we are going to do it. This will be our final sum and we will return this final sum. We don't have to print the number, we have to simply return the sum. First calculate the sum of all the smaller numbers and add it in that. And for n is equal to 0, what value will we return? We will return the value equal to 0. Now we have, I have to print this value, yes, let's store it in a variable. Sum variable and I'll print the sum. Let's save it and re-execute. So, we have the sum of numbers from 1 to 5, equal to 15. Similarly, if I want the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, then that is going to be equal to 55. In this way, we can recursively calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to n. Next, let's come to another question. Write a recursive function to print all elements in a list. In this, there is a hint that in the function, list will become our parameter and an index parameter. So we have to recursively print all the elements of the list. For example, I have a list A, B, C. I have to recursively print all the elements of this. So what I can say is that if the value of index is 0 then first print this. Then the value of index should increase to 1 then print this. Then the value of index should be 2 then print this. So every time in every function call what I have to do is change the value of my index by doing plus 1, plus 1, plus 1 and send it. And what will be the stopping condition base case? Base case will be when my index value is equal to the length of list. Because when index value is 3 then you don't have to print anything, then come back. So let's try to write this once. What I have to do is print my list. Underscore list. I will have two parameters in it, one will be my list and one will be my index. What is the work? The work is that you have index go to list and print that index value and then for other index i.e. call for next index, then we will call print list for our list and this time we will make index plus 1 first it was 0, sorry this should be index first index was 0, now it will be 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, till where? Till the index value is not equal to the length of the list. Where the value of index is equal to the length of the list, simply return from there. This is a recursive function. How? Print list is calling itself, only with some updations. Why is index updating? otherwise loop will become infinite, sorry, our recursion will become infinite, so if we here, let's suppose we create a list called fruits, we have mango, we have lychee, we have apple and we have banana. Let's save it and call print list for our fruits list. Let's save it and run it. Ok, we have passed fruits in the list but we have to pass the starting value of index. So, if we don't pass the starting value of index here, we can make it an optional parameter. Start with index is equal to 0. So, mango is printed, leach is printed, apple is printed, banana is printed. I hope we understood its understanding and working. First, for fruits, what was the call for? For index number 0. First we checked if it is equal to 0 length or not. So what did it print? It printed mango. Then index increased. So next call, the value of index in it became 1. For 1, it printed lychee. Then the value of index became 2. Then it printed apple. Then banana. Then again the value of index became equal to 4. It checked in 4, now it is equal to length, now don't print anything, so now we will return from here. So this way recursion works, rest all the codes we have written for recursion, as a beginner, it can be difficult for us. So if we need to see things by repeating, then it is not then don't worry, just repeat them because time takes to understand recursion the more time you invest in learning, the better you will understand things the stronger our core concepts will be so I hope that you enjoyed reading recursion or functions so that's all for today's lecture you, till then keep learning and keep practicing.

# Lecture 7
 Hi Coders and welcome to the complete Python series in which today we will cover our chapter 7 in which we will study about file IO. How we can perform different operations on files, how data is written in a file, how a file is read, how data is deleted. Today we are going to cover all the things, so we will not only study the concepts, we will actually perform all the operations and with that we will will solve different practice questions also. So if we want to study any other topic related to Python, So let's start with our chapter 7. Hi everyone, and now we are going to start with our 7th chapter in which we are going to read about file I.O. Now what does file I.O. mean? I.O. means input and output. In terms of files, we all know that we have been making Python files, we have seen different types of files, all the pictures we take, all the videos we have, all the files are stored in the format in any system. Now in the file, IO means to do input output means we are opening a file, we are reading some data in it, we are doing some updations in it, we are writing some new data, we are closing that file, we are deleting that file, different operations of this type come under the category of file IO. So basically, Python as a language can be used to perform operations on a file. For example, if a file is saved on your computer, then we can perform operations on it. That means we can write lines like this in our code, we can write this type of code which will access that file, can read the data inside it, can write lines like this, we can write code like this, which will access that file, can read the data inside it, can write, update, append data inside it and more different operations. Now before starting file I.O, there are some basic things which we might have read in school, or if we have some background in computer science, then we will already have a basic idea. This comes as is theoretical part. So maximum students must have heard of RAM. Random Access Memory. RAM is the memory of our computer which is fast in execution. When a code runs, all the variables are created in RAM. But RAM is volatile. Volatile means that once we shut down our system, the data in RAM refreshes. That data is not stored permanently for ever. But if we want to store any information permanently in our system, for example, whenever we open the system, we see that information, then we do not store that information in RAM. We can store it in the form of our files. There are different ways, but we can store it in the form of our files. There are different ways but we can store it in the form of file. For example, we wrote a Python code. Now we don't want to restart the system by closing our laptop so that our code disappears completely. So what we do is we store the entire code of Python in the files. Similarly, if we downloaded a photo in our system, we don't want to restart our system as soon as we close it so that our photo or videos get disappeared so those videos and photos are not stored permanently in RAM if we want to store them permanently, persist them then we store them in the form of files like if we have a photo, it can be a PNG file it can be a JPEG file if we have a video, it can be a file in file, a JPEG file, a video, it can be a file in.MOV format,.MP4 format. If it is a Python file, it can be in.py, if it is a text file, it can be in.txt. So, there are different files stored in our system in this way. Now, these files are stored in the system if there is an SSD in our system, otherwise, if there is an HDD, it is stored in it. So, if we talk about files, then Python can be used to perform different operations on a file. And these different operations, which are our read and write, the major operations, that we can read the data from the file and we can rewrite the data in the file. These major operations together form the file IO in Python. If we talk in a very simple language, then in this chapter we are going to learn how can we open a file, how can we read data from a file, how can we write some data to a file, how can we close a file, and at the end how can we delete a file. Now let's see the types of files. All the files can be divided into two types. One is our text files. Text files are those files in which the data is stored in the form of characters. For example, our.txt file, we get to see characters in this. Our.docs file, we can make our word document on Microsoft docs. That is a text file..log, the logs of our system stored in this type of files. So what is this? This is also our text file. And the non-text files in which data is not stored in the character form but can be stored in some other format. We call them binary files. Like.mp4 which are our video files, they are also binary files..mov, this is also an extension of our video file..png,.jpg all these files are our binary files so we can manipulate both the files and access both the types of files we can perform IO on them using python now one additional thing here is that even if text files and binary files are different when we access them from python code but at the end when all these files are stored in memory they are all bits means all the data whether it is binary file data or text file data in system memory it is stored in the form of 0 and 1 so we can remember this thing all the files at the end are bits bits data is there in them 0 and 1 but we divide them in text and binary files at upper surface level. Now first of all let's talk about the basic operations on the file. Generally the simplest operation that we can perform on a file is that we open a file. For example you must have a lot of books and inside the books you must have a lot of academic files. So day to day the actual physical file that we have, how do we use it? First of all, we bring the file and open the file. And after opening the file, we can read some data from it, we can write some data, then we close the file at the end. So, these same operations we replicate in Python. So, before reading any file or writing anything in it, we have to open the file. And for that we have existing built-in functions in Python. We simply write our open function. We have to pass two parameters in open. First of all, we send the name of our file in double quotes and single quotes. So for example, my file name is sample.txt. So what I have to do is write the full name of my file here. And after that we send our mode. Mode means what format our file is going to be of IO perform. Are we going to read in this file? Are we going to write in this? Are we going to append data in this? What are we actually going to do by opening this file? So we have to tell that thing from the beginning. And if we don't tell anything, then by default python assumes that we are going to read the file. So if you are opening in read mode and you will try to write in any file then that thing will not be possible, we will get an error. Now there are many modes, for now we will focus on a simple mode which is my read mode. So this open method can be assumed at surface level in surface level, it is returning our file. For example, if we try to open a file, for example, here we have made a folder, in the folder we already have our python file lecture7.py, in this let's suppose I create another text file, I call this file demo.txt, in this demo.txt I have written some data in this demo.txt. I, data can be anything, I am learning. I have written here Python from my college. In this way I have written something. So this is my demo.txt file. Now to open this file I can use my open method. And when we scroll on this, we will see its full definition. How this method it is following the Python syntax then the method name is open it has different parameters which we can take but for now our two main parameters are the file description or its path and second thing is our mode and it is also written that if no other parameter is passed then it is a default parameter we will open our file in read mode. So in this way our file opens and returns the text IO wrapper. We will not go into so much detail now. We will assume that our file will be returned to us. As it is written here, opens a file and returns a stream. Stream means stream of characters, stream of data is returned to us. So here the first thing we will pass the name of our file if I didn't pass demo.txt in the same folder then we would have to send the complete path of the file now in the same folder where python file is where we have to try to access txt there is our txt file so we can write demo demo.txt here but if this is not the same folder stored in some other folder stored somewhere else then we have to pass the complete path of that file here what is the complete path of any file? like if I go here if I copy the entire path of this file then I will know where is this demo.txt in users in amandatarwal in desktop will know where is this demo.txt, inside users, inside Amandat Arwal, inside desktop, inside Shraddha, demo.txt. Our file is being stored here. Alright, let's come here, our file name has come and now let's pass our mode. We have different modes, by the way, so many modes are not used frequently, what is used frequently among them, we will cover that. This is in our read mode, so we have typed R and we have our file. So, in this way we open a file. Now after opening we can perform operations on it. The most basic operation is to read, so we can simply write f.read and what will it return to us? It will return the whole data of our file in the form of a string. For example, I can write data is equal to f.read, let's zoom in a little bit and I can print my entire data along with the type of my data. Let's save it and let's run it. So here I have the entire data of my file, what is the data? I am learning Python from my college and its type also came which is string and at the end always before executing the program, a good programmer's sign will be that whenever we are opening a file, we have to close it, there is nothing to close, we have written f.close, like we close real life files at the end, what will happen if they remain open? Basically there is a risk that anyone can access your file data anywhere anyone can change that data. So what you have to do is as a responsible programmer we will close this file here. We have saved it and this is an entire program consisting of file I.O in Python. Here we have seen how we can write the name of the file and with that we have different options available in the modes. For example, the R option is open for reading, this is our default option. Why is W? W is for writing, truncating the file first, truncating the file first means whenever we are trying to write in a file, then write means overwrite here, that is, the whole file data will in a file, then write means overwrite here. That means the whole file data will be deleted first, then whatever you want to write will be written in that file. We are going to read this in detail now. X is used to create a new file and open it for writing. A means append here, we are going to see this later. It is used to open for writing and appending to the end of the file if it exists. If there is a file with some data, ABC, we want to delete it and add new data XYZ. For that we use write. And if we want to add new data after ABC, we use append. Append in English means adding something at the end. Apart from this we have two more formats. One is this mode, Binary mode. If we are trying to open a binary file, we will write B for that. And if we are trying to open a text file, we will write T. Here we did not write T. We did not write T here because if we had written T, we could have combined two modes. For combining R and T, we write RT. But text files are open by default. If you want to do binary file, you have to write R. We have to write W and A. But if we are opening text files, even if we remove T, there is no problem. Here the same code will work without any error so T is implicit already T is used by default in text mode apart from this we have plus opens a disk file for updating that is reading and writing means we want to do two operations together so for that we can use plus to use plus means let's assume R means to read the file so R plus means I have to read and write in this file If we have written W, then W means to write W plus means I have to write and read in this file If we have written A, A means to append A plus means I have to append and read the data in this file So we will use plus in this way also but we will see it later For now we have learnt one mode which is my R mode, which is used for reading, it is the default mode. And apart from this, our text mode is also our default mode. Next, if we want to read reading in more detail, first of all, we have seen that to read data from inside the file, we can use our read method, in some way. Ok, inside the read method, we can pass one more parameter. If I want, I have opened the file here, if I want to read a particular set of characters, we can pass it as a parameter. Here I have passed an argument that I have to read 5 letters from the beginning. 5 letters means i space am another space. Let's save it and run it. So we will have only i am printed and nothing else will be printed. So we can specify the number of characters also. Rest we can read any file line by line also. To read line by line we write read line this second method which reads a file one line at a time. To use this we can write line1 and readline here. Let's remove this argument and we will print our line1. We save it and run it. So we have I am learning line which was the first line in demo.txt. Whenever we are printing line 1 we are getting an extra space extra space is because in the file when this data is I am learning and all the data is coming in the next line then here a character is there backslash n which brings the next line the character is not visible as such but because of that next line is coming that character exists in this file and because here in line, that character exists in this file and because here in line 1 that character has been read, so now here we have a space of next line similarly we can read our second line also, we will copy it here we read our first line and now we will read our second line so this is line 2, we will call it line 2. We will save it. And let's re-execute. So this is our line 1. The next line character of the end line is displayed. And then our line 2 is displayed here. If we have already read any file, like I wrote data is equal to f.read and then I printed the data. So in that case, when I look at my output, so my output will be printed as normal output and when I print line 1, I will get empty space. When I print line 2, I will get empty space. This is coming because if we read the data once, then to visualize it, for example my data is in ABC, XYZ, PYQ so here let's suppose we want to read the data so what we are doing is, as soon as we read our pointer, we can imagine a pointer like our cursor we can imagine it as a cursor so what does that cursor do? it reads all the characters one by one now that cursor reaches the last as soon as it executes the read that cursor reaches the last and now when we try to read the line what will it read? it will read only the next line character nothing will come in it it will print empty space so basically if the whole data is read once then it has nothing to read in the next line. So if we read it first, then things are printed empty in the read line. Also, when we are doing read line, if we remove this thing and we are doing read line one by one, then how things are working? So first of all, what that cursor does is, it reads one line and comes to its end. Then it reads the second line and comes to its end. Then it reads the second line and comes to the end of it. Then it reads the third line and comes to the end of it. So in this way, line by line, line by line, we can read our file until our file ends. If our file ends at one point, like we have read the line twice, then if we read the line for the third time, then it doesn't have any data to print further. So in that case, an empty next line will be printed for us. What is this? This is an empty next line which will get printed if we don't have any more data in the file. So, this is going to happen. So, there is a difference between read and read line. When we are reading the whole data, then we can read the whole data at once. But, keep in mind that it moves the cursor. So, next time we will not be able to read line from the starting. For that, we have to close the file again, reopen it so that we can read it again line by line. Next thing we are going to read is writing to a file. Now we have seen how we can access any data stored in the file. Now we are going to write on the file. Before writing we have to open the file and there are two ways to write. One is that we open the file in write mode. There is one way to open the file in W mode. We open the file in A mode. When we open the file in W mode, this is my write mode. I will call write as overwrite mode. And A is our append mode. Append means add at the end. I will write add at the end. I will write add at the end. So both have different cases. Let's suppose we open the same file and open it in write mode. So now by writing f.write I can write any data in this file. I have to replace, let's suppose I want to write I am or I want to learn java script tomorrow, I have written something like this, 1, 2, 3, some numbers also written and let's save it and close it. Now as soon as I run this code, now we will go to demo.txt, our whole data is overwritten. And if we want to append things in this data, we have to open the same file in A mode. And now this data will be added, that is, it will be appended in the old data. So let's make some changes here. Let's change this and write then I'll move to react.js, let's save it and execute. Now what happened is this new data came into my file and added. Why did this data get added in the same line? Because we didn't give any next line character. So if I want to move my data to the next line, then I have to write backslash n and give a next line character. For example, I want to add more data. After that, save Node.js and run it. Now this data will come with a next line character. That is, it will come to this next line and come to my demo.txt. So in this way, we can overwrite data in anywrite or append data in any file. Another interesting thing is that whenever we open any file in A or W mode and that file doesn't exist, then Python automatically creates that file for us. For example, I want to open this file called sample.txt and I am opening it in write mode. And then I did nothing and closed it. Now here in my folder no such file exists but as soon as I run this code, the same sample.txt file will be created here. The same thing, let's delete it once, the same thing if I open the file in append mode then also it will exist. Let's run it. What is this? Sample.txt file has been created. So if we don't have any file then we can create it in this way also. If we want to create and write in a file. Now let's suppose we want to combine our modes. Means I want to do reading and writing simultaneously. So there are many different ways of doing it. There is this one particular article, I will give you the link, it is very interesting, in this, on Slack overflow, he has explained 14 years ago that what are the differences between different modes in open method. So, we will get many ideas from this, you will see a helpful flowchart which you can see and different meanings are explained if you want to read in more detail. Rest we write the modes in this way to combine, if we open in R mode then we are reading, writing in W, appending in A, this is the simplest thing. Like if I show some data in demo.txt from the starting, this is a sample file, We have written the data in this way. So here if we open the file in R plus mode then what will it do? It will open it for reading and writing. And in this case our file is not truncated. Truncating of the file means the data is deleted from it. So file is not truncated in R plus mode. File is truncated in W plus mode. There are some differences. We will read one by one. What is R plus? R plus is for reading and writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file. This stream is basically like a pointer which is positioned at the beginning of the file. For example, in my file demo.txt this is a sample file. We have written only this much. Let's open it once. We will see everything working once. Then we will understand. Alright. Here we will write everything working then we will understand alright here we will write R plus so we opened in read mode this is our sample file then what I did in F I wrote ABC and then I closed the file I just did this much work let's save it and run what happened after running first ABC came in the file and what inside the file and ABC overwrote things. Because things in R plus mode are overwritten. But where did it overwrite? In the starting of the file. Earlier, it was THIS. Now, THI has been replaced with ABC. So, things have to be overwritten from the beginning inside the file. So, what do we do? We can open it in R plus mode. I hope we understood from R plus, our stream, our pointer comes in the beginning and then we can use it to write it if we want, then we can also read it, that is, if I want to print R print F dot read, then the whole file will also be read, for example, overwrite ABC from ABC, here we have ABC, now where is the pointer? Now the pointer is here, the pointer comes on S. Everything that is being read and written is happening through the pointer. The pointer has written ABC, so it has come on S and where the pointer will come, it will start reading from there. So when we call read, it will start printing from S only. So I hope you are understanding the concept of pointer and stream. So this is R plus mode, we have already seen W. What happens in W plus mode? It is open for reading and writing. But in this case our file will be truncated. By truncated it means it will be completely wiped out. Like if I open this file in W plus and then I want to read it. Let's comment out a little bit. I opened this file in W plus mode and I want to read it. Let's comment out a little. I opened this file in W plus mode and I want to read it. So what will be printed? Nothing will be printed. Because the file is open in truncated mode, so all its data will be empty. After that, we can write if we want. Then I can write f.write abc. In this case, an empty thing was printed, but in the file I have now written abc. Similarly we have A plus mode which is append plus, by the way these are the main modes apart from this we don't need to go into much detail and in this case the stream is positioned at the end of the file. That means if I open it in A plus mode and then I tried to read it first then in that case also nothing will be printed, why it will not be printed? because it will place my pointer at the end, we will save it, if we read it then nothing will be printed and then ABC will be written inside the file, but it will not be overwrite, it will be append if we read it then nothing will be printed, inside demo.txt after abc we have written abc again so we have opened the file in append plus, read and append mode so let's summarize all the things once. Our modes must have been the most confusing so far. So let's summarize them once which were important. Simple modes, read, write, append. These were the simplest to understand. We must have understood this. Now apart from this we have read three more. The first thing we have read is read plus. What happens in read plus? We can read and we can overwrite existing data And where is pointer in this? Pointer is in start Pointer starts from starting Second is write plus mode What is in write plus mode? We can read and overwrite In this case no truncate. In this case truncate is done. But in this case if the data of the file is deleted then there is no point in the starting or end because the file is empty. Third mode is A plus mode. In this read and append is empty. The third mode is A plus mode. In this, read and append is used. And whenever append is used, the pointer will be at the end. And in this also, no truncate. That means the file data is not deleted, it remains the same. So these are the major differences. R plus, W plus, A plus, all of them are the same, read and write. We just have to see where the pointer is, who is is doing truncate, we have to remember that. You can note down this thing in your notes once, this thing is important to remember, we will see how we can implement it later. So these are our modes and one last thing which we are going to cover to cover is my with syntax. In the process of opening and closing a file, there is another better syntax to write it in Python which is using the with keyword. First we write with, then we write our open function and then we write as f. That is, we will call the whole stream of the file f and then we can perform operations on f. Just like we are writing things in a normal function, the same syntax is there here. It's like a loop or a conditional statement. It's not just that, all the indented parts in it, by spacing all the parts inside it, will depend on this stream. Just like this same code like a normal code, I have to open the file read the data in it and then close it if I have to do this much code this is a sample file by our college in this way we have written something in the file now I have to open this file and read its data so before with syntax we will write with after that open, in in the file in this way. Now I have to open this file and read its data. So before with syntax we will write with and then open. In open the file name is demo.txt. In which mode we are opening it? Let's open it in read mode. As if. Now the thing that will come from here, as means aliases. Alias means Like Clark Kent is an alias for Superman or Superman is an alias for Clark Kent. Basically we are talking about the same thing, we just called him Clark Kent sometimes, sometimes we called him Superman. Like if you have seen Avengers, then sometimes we called him Tony Stark, sometimes we called him Iron Man. So the same thing is happening, sometimes we call the same thing Shaktimaan, sometimes we call him Vidyadhar. We are giving the same thing another name, we call it as Alias in English. So here our alias for that thing is F. And then we will put colon. Now we can work on F. Means whatever value this thing will return, we are giving it an alias, we are giving it a name F. Now I can read data from F and I can print this data. Let's store it in some variable and let's try to print this data. Let's save it and run. So our data has been printed. Now here you can point out one thing that ma'am you said that there is a sign of good programmer, we have to close f dot but that thing when we use with syntax it is not compulsory because automatically with will automatically close the file. So whenever we use with we don't have to think about closing the file because that thing will be done automatically. If I want to open this file in write then I can open it like this. Open the file demo.txt in write mode and we will overwrite its data as f.write new data. So let's save it and let's execute. So first its old data came to us and now new data has been stored for us. So in this way we can use with syntax whenever we are working with our files. Now the last operation which we are going to see is deleting a file. Now as such we cannot delete a file by deleting f dot. For that we have to use a module. What are the modules in Python? Modules are like a code library. Modules are basically a Python file written by someone else for us which has some useful functions which we can use. So to use any module, first of all we have to import it. So we have a module named OS in Python. OS stands for operating system. And what we do is, first we import it in our code, in our file. So for that we write our import keyword and then the name of our module. If we want we can import any module. There are some modules which are already pre-installed in Python. For example, if I do import OS and save it and try to run my program, there will be no issue, my code will be run, there is no error at all. But apart from this there are many modules which are not pre-installed. For example, if I try to write tensorflow and save it and try to run, then what will come here? We will get an error. No module named tensorflow. Tensorflow is basically a module which we use while doing machine learning, while building our neural networks. But what is it now? It is not installed yet, so we have to install it from the internet. If we want to use such modules in Python which are not pre-installed yet, then we have to write PIP. PIP is package installer for Python. PIP install and then the name of our module. So if you want to install TensorFlow in your your system you can write pip install tensorflow and in the same way it can be done in your system depending upon which version of python you have installed and in what way it is installed it is possible that the pip command doesn't work for you so you have to write pip3 install tensorflow. I am not able to show you this by writing because the system on which I am recording this is not my own system. So basically by writing this line we can install any external module not only tensorflow but any extra module if you want to use it. But here we are going to use our OS module which is pre-installed with us. So I will just write import OS and now we can use any function of OS. So there is a function inside OS, written from before, written by someone else. Remove function in which we can pass the name of our file or path. So that file will be automatically deleted for us. Like if I write OS.remove and I want to remove this demo.txt file, this sample.txt file, then I will write sample.txt, let's save it, let's run it. So what will happen, it crossed over sample.txt, means it is deleted now. So we will go to this file, so this whole file is now deleted, it has also disappeared from our folder. So in this way, if we delete any file if we want. So this was all about file IO, how we can open files, perform operations on them, and delete those files. Now we are going to solve some practice questions related to file IO. So let's come to our practice questions. First of all, the practice question says, Create a new file, practice.txt using python, add the following data in it. And we have to keep the format of this data in this way. That means where data is coming in next line, we should have next line. So let's try to create this file once. To create the file, what we can do is, we can open it in write mode. As soon as we open any file in write mode, it will automatically be created. So with open, let's cross this one. We want to create a file named practice.txt in write mode. And in this, as f, in f.write, let's write the first line hi everyone backslash n we are learning file i slash o backslash n second line, let's write one more in f dot write using java backslash and I like programming in java so this is our file and let's save it let's try to run our code and for us practice dot dtxt has been created and all the text has come in it as it was told to create. Let's move towards the next question. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of Java with Python. Where Java will come with capital J. What we have to do is in the same file, the practice.txt that we have created, wherever Java is coming, Python should come for us. So, first of all, we have to pause and think about which functions, what kind of inbuilt methods we have seen in strings or in any other data type that can help us to achieve our work. So what will be our basic framework? First of all, we have to replace all the occurrences. So what can I say? Here we have to read some data first. Read means we have to know what is written in the file first. After that, we will overwrite the data in the file. That is, the existing data, first we will read it and remove the data. Then we will make changes in that data and then we will overwrite the data in our file with the new changes. So first of all, what we can do to read is open our file in read mode and take a data variable here. In which we will read and store all the data of our file. Now I have to make changes in this data. So to make changes in the data, we will get all the data. If I want to replace Java with Python in this data, then because the data is a string, we have a replace method to replace it in the string. So we can simply write data.replace. We want to replace Java with Python. And then we can simply write data.replace We want to replace java with python And then we can print it Our new data Ok don't leave it like this What it will do is it will return new data So what we need here New data This is my new data And we will print the new data Save it Run it So we got this new data In which every time where java was written, python was written now with this data I have to overwrite my file, so let's open the file again this time we will open in write mode and we will write f dot with our new data let's save it let's run it now we will open our file so wherever java was now we have python printed there so in this way we can overwrite the data in any file let's move towards the next question search if the word learning exists in the file or not we have to check whether this word exists in the file or not? We have to check whether this word exists in our file or not. Now we already know that learning exists in this file. How do we find out with the code? So to solve this, what we will do is we will open our file practice.txt in read mode and first of all we get all its data, f.asf, f.read and then if we call data.find inside that data because find is our method by which we can find any substring inside any string. So inside find when we find our learning, or in fact if I write here word is equal to learning, we want to find this word. So in find, if to find this word, we don't have minus 1, so it means we have got a valid index. In that case we will print found and in other cases we can print not found. Let's save it and run it. Because learning exists in our file, so found will be printed for that. And if I search for learning or xlearning something like this, then not found will be printed for that found will be printed and if I search for learning or xlearning something like this then not found will be printed for that. Ok the last question and this question we can convert both of them in the function. Like in the last question function was written but I have written it directly. So to convert any normal thing in the function we don't have to do anything, we will just write def. Like this whole process, checkForWord, so what is checkForWord? I gave it a name, check if the word exists. And then we will write all this code in our function. So here we have written this whole code in our function with proper indentation. And whenever we need we can call our check for word this is very simple next question next question is write a function to find in which line of the file does the word learning occur first so we have to tell exact line in which line has our word in it, it comes first. We have to write a function for that. So to find, to check, we have already written, let's make another function. Let's call it checkForLine. Whenever we want to check linewise, the first thing that should come to mind is readLine. This time we will not read the whole thing, we will read line by line. First let's write our word. My word is going to be learning. After that we will open our file as usual. And now we will start reading the data line by line. How do we know that when we are reading data line by line, when we reached the last? Means we have to read the file completely till our word comes. So for that we can do one thing, we will initialize the data with some value. Like I initialized it with true, that data is true in the beginning. And we will keep running our code till the time our data value is equal to true till then keep reading the row line till then I have to do f.readline like this and we will update our data value so this one line is read and after that we performed some operations then we will see if the data is true after that we will read the next line true, then we will read the next line again and again. And while data means basically that until there is a valid value in the data, true is also a valid value and other values are also valid values. But when our read line returns empty string, that is not a valid value, in that case we will get out of the loop. So we have read the first line, we can track the line number also. My line number initially is 1. We have read the line and then we will check whether word exists in our line. So there will be one way that I will try to find in the data whether my word exists. By the way there is another easy way to write this, if word in data, in means basically python is checking for us whether this word or data exists in the string. So here we can convert the code we have written, if word in data, so our code will work as it is. In fact this is a better syntax of writing things. Now let's come here, check for line, if word exists in data, in that case what we have to do is print our line number and if it doesn't then it's okay, we will update our line number by 1. So I hope you understood this logic let's see it once our normal function is check for line we have to search this word in the beginning the data value is true true because for starting iteration we want to run the loop if we initialize it with empty string then the loop will not run in the beginning the value of line number is 1. Then we will open our file and start reading. How will we read? Line by line. And till then we will keep reading until the data value is empty. Read the first line. Did you see if our word exists in it? If it does then print the line. And in fact we can directly return from here after printing. If it doesn't then it's okay, update the line and go to the next line. If we go to the next line, read the line again, check it again, if it doesn't exist, update it again and go to the next line. And at the end, means if that word doesn't exist, then in that case I have to return minus 1. So at the end, if the word doesn't exist, means if this whole thing is finished, if the word does not exist, then finally I will return minus 1. And if it exists then the control has already been returned, we have already come out of this function. Let's call this function checkForLine, so it will tell us the exact line number. This is our line number 1, this is our line number 2. We will search, word exists in line number 2. If I want to search something else instead of learning, for example, I want to search for programming. Let's do programming to this word. So it exists in line number 4. And if I search word pyq, then it doesn't exist. So in that case, what am I getting? I am getting nothing. Because I have returned this minus 1 but I have not printed it. But I will definitely get minus 1 if I get it printed. So this is our minus 1. So in this way, we can start performing some complex operations by combining all the basic knowledge. Let's move towards the last question. From a file containing numbers separated by comma, like we have numbers 1, 2, 45, 55, 86, 76, we have some numbers like this in a file separated by a comma we have to print how many numbers are even numbers this time not string, this time we are given numbers first of all let's read the data from the file in practice.txt if we want we can overwrite the whole data let's overwrite this data 1276 84 90 101. This is the way we have written the data. This is the type of data we would have been given. We already know that the data is given by separating it from the comma. First of all, let will open the file and read this data. With openpractice.txt We are going to open it in read mode. And let's fetch our data. f.read as f And we will print our data. Our proper data has come to us. The only problem is that this data is in full string format. But for numbers odd or even we have to remove individual number and actually convert it into integer value. So first thing we have to do is remove individual numbers. Then we have to parse those individual numbers. Parse means we have to find individual numbers we have to find individual numbers then we have to parse those individual numbers parse means converting our data casting or we can also call it casting, we have to type cast to integer value parsing is also the correct word, casting is also the correct word first find individual numbers first find 1, then 2, then 45, what is this? It is substring. And then what we will have to do is we will have to cast that data to integer values. So in Python if we want to split any string in any list, i.e. we want to break it, then we have an already existing method which is called the split method. And if we get confused that whether any method exists or not, simply we can search it and see. So what we can do is we can use this split method or in fact I will show you once without split method. If I have to do this work without split method, that is, if I have to subtract individual numbers from the string, then what I will do is, I will track till when my comma is coming. The part before comma is a complete number. This is a complete number, this is a complete number, this is a complete number. And logically, if I have to write a loop without the method, then that can also be done. For example, I can take some number and I will initialize the number with an empty string. And I will run my loop till then, let's take a for loop. For i in range, till then we will run that loop, till the data's length is equal to our loop. So one by one the value of i will keep updating from 0. Now after that we will check if the current item i is equal to comma at any point At that point I have got a complete number I have to assume that as soon as I reached comma Means before that I have got a complete number Now I can check for this number In fact I can print my number here And if we are not at comma then what should we do? in number do plus equal to current character means if we are not on comma then first add 4 then add 5 in 4, in this way keep adding numbers until we reach comma, so until we don't reach comma we have to keep doing this and as soon as we reach comma print your number and initialize the number again with empty string. Let me show you how this is going to print all of my numbers. This is a very basic code. I run it and all my numbers are printed. The problem is that they are printed with space but I can remove that space if I want. But we got the basic gist that 1 is printed, 2 is printed, 76 is printed, 84 is printed now if you want you can type cast these numbers like I can convert all these before printing to integer value if I convert to integer space will be split run, first 1 came, 2 came, 76 came, 84 came, 90 came now check if it is odd or even this is the basic way, means is the basic way of doing things. But there is one better way than this. We will make a list named numbers. I will write data.split using this separator. And then I can print my list. This is my numbers list. Done. So all these numbers, comma was separator. On the basis of that I have taken out all my strings. Now this individual string type cast it in int. Means we can put a loop on this nums. For value in nums what will I will check if my int of value modulo 2 equals 0. In that case I have to do my count plus plus. Let's take count variable or in fact let's take it here. Count is equal right now equal to 0. And here my count will be plus equal to 1 and in the last we will print our count. First I took count and read the data, then after that by splitting the data using my comma separator I created a list of numbers from it. After that I checked, by running a loop on that list by type casting my values that is my number an even value if it is even then I did count it as plus plus and I printed my count. Let's save it and run it. So total number of even numbers is equal to 4 I also didn't check, let's check now. 2 is even, 76 is even, 84 is even, 90 is even. So I have 4 even numbers in this list So my count is completely alright So in this way we can use our file IO to perform different operations on our files So I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter We will cover more interesting concepts in our next chapter In which we will cover OOPS, Object Orientation That's all for today, see you in the next lecture Till then keep learning and keep practicing in which we will cover OOPS, Object Orientation That's all for today, see you in the next lecture, till then keep learning and keep practicing

# Lecture 8
 Hi everyone and welcome to the complete Python series in which today is our chapter 8 in which we will cover about object oriented programming using Python. That is, what does our classes, objects, constructors, static methods mean? We are going to cover all these things in this chapter. We will talk about different concepts which will make us better as a programmer. So as usual So let's start with our chapter 8. Hi everyone, now we are going to start with our chapter 8 in which we will study objects and classes, that is, about object-oriented programming, its different fundamentals. And in fact, object-oriented programming is one of the most important topics of any programming language because questions related to this are asked a lot in interviews. In fact, many theoretical concepts, many practical concepts which we are using in companies to actually build systems, many of those concepts come out of object oriented programming. It is possible that today we are doing our programming for the first time in Python, we are learning something new in the company, learning a new framework, working on a new language, then also it is possible that some similar concepts which we will learn in this chapter, we are applying in some other language so this is going to be one of the most important concepts which will teach us many more things about programming. Now first of all let's talk about what is object oriented programming basically to map with real world scenarios we started using objects in code. In the beginning we used to do procedural programming. Procedural means that the whole code was written sequentially. For example I have written my variable a is equal to 10, my second variable is b is equal to 20, I have made a sum, sum is equal to this a plus this b, then I am trying to print my sum a plus or write my sum variable after that I have to calculate a difference for difference I am going to write a minus b and after that I have printed my difference in this way I have done a lot of code I have written it simple but we are imagining it as a lot of code which we have written one after one and then we learnt concept functions that is in the beginning of many classes we were writing the code in the same way normally in a sequence first one line then another line then third line then fourth line and we know that our code will be executed in a sequence this is called procedural programming then we learnt concept of functions functions taught us how to bring reusability in code, to reduce redundancy and bring reusability, let me write these words, because of functions redundancy decreases and reusability increases, what happens is that it increases. It means that if some things are repeated then if you combine them and make a single function then what happens is that redundancy decreases and reusability increases. Now the piece of code that we made by calling it a function, we can use it again and again. That is why functions were really important. So basically we moved from procedural to functional programming which is better. Now there is another level up method than function which we call object oriented programming which we are going to learn in this chapter we know that we can make functions but to decrease redundancy and reusability, this is more important to increase reusability we can use objects and classes also. Now, using function in code is not compulsory, it is our wish. If we feel that I have a piece of code which I should make a function, then we make it a function. We don't make everything a function. Similarly, if we feel that we have to use classes and objects in a code, then we use object orientation. So that is completely on us. We are reading important concepts but using these concepts is not compulsory. But yes, from an interview point of view and practical programming point of view, we should know all these concepts if we want to become a good developer, if we want to become a good programmer. In the real world, we have heard both object and class. What do we call object in real world? We can call anything object, this mouse is an object, this keyboard is an object, this pencil is going to be an object, everything is an object. So here also the same thing happens, anything can be made an object, so here also the same thing happens, that is anything can be made an object, but before making an object, we make a class of that object, in object oriented programming, directly we don't make objects, before making an object, a class of an object is made, class is basically a blueprint, we will study these two terms in detail. So first we make a class like we had a class in our school. Then we start to put each student in it. This is our one student, this is an object, this is an object, this is an object, this is an object. So in this way we will go imagining all our things that the concepts used in programming, how we can connect them in real world to solve real world problems. And in fact very interesting thing that we have already dealt with many objects and classes in python. The list in python, lists are objects, the strings are objects. And we will realize slowly till the end of this chapter what these terms mean and how we were already using them. Also our object orientation chapter is a little theoretical, but we will be understanding it very easily with a lot of different examples. Now, first of all, we are going to talk about what exactly class and object mean in object orientation. First of all, let's talk about class. Class is a blueprint for creating objects. Like a blueprint, let's assume, a car has installed its factory. The line in which cars will be produced, like Mercedes GLS is a car, before making it, its blueprint will be ready. All the cars of the same model should have these features. Basically, class is the blueprint in which we first tell what features should be there. So basically class is that blueprint in which we first tell what all features should be there in the object. If we are going to bring a student in the college, then what all information is there for that student which we have to save in our system. We have to save the name of the student, we have to save his address, we have to save his roll number, how much information is there. So whatever information we have to save for a particular object, we are writing it in a class and we call it a blueprint for an object. For example, we have to make a system for our college, now college tells us that we have to store information of many students, one way is to store the information of many students in the form of a list, for example, this is my list, first store the student's name in the list. This is the student's name, after that store their marks. We can store anything, after that store different relevant information. We can do it with list, dictionary, there are many different ways. But the most practical way would be to use a concept of a class and object. How? First of all we will define a blueprint. That is we will write a class and define what we want to store for the student. So to define the class we write the class keyword and then we write the name of our class. The name of the class can be anything like the name of the variable. And generally the name of our class we always start with a capital letter. So we made a class with student name and now we are telling what information should be stored for student. So in our code let's try to create a class, we are making a class student and in this student class let's suppose I just have to save the name. For now all my students, I want to give the same name to all. What I have given to all is same all, means in a student class, whatever student will be made, his name will always be the same name, now what can we do, I have made this student, but we do not use classes directly, then we have to make the object of the class, we can imagine it as we have a class in our school, but there will be a class alone in it, it will not be of any use, when the When students are sitting in the class, the actual students are of benefit. So, similarly here we make objects using the class blueprint. Like in the factory we made a blueprint that this should be a feature inside a car. But then actually we will have to make a car using that blueprint. The actual car that is made, we call it object. So, to create an object, we write our object variable its name is equal to then class name and then parenthesis. So this way we can create a new object. The objects we have we call them instance in programming. Instance or instances of class. Whenever we hear instance or object we are basically talking about the same thing. So here if I want to make student as S1 So to create it we can write as equal to student Whichever is the name of my class I have to write it exactly here And then we will put our parenthesis And after that we can print our student if we want. Let's try to print S1 As soon as we execute it, what is printed for s1, for s1 print main.student object at this location but basically we got this idea that what is this, this is an object which is created in our code and what is its type, this is an object of student class which is created for us in our code, if we want we can also print the name. Now this name because it was in the blueprint, if we define once in the blueprint that every car should be blue, then all the cars will have blue color. So in the same way if we define in the blueprint that my student's name should be Karan every time, then as soon as we write s1.name, Karan will come and print for me which is going to be the name same for every student similarly if I make another student s2 is equal to student and we will print s2.name then same thing will be printed here also we will have same value for both the students now we will learn how to change this value but for now we have seen that if we want to make a class in a basic way then we can make something like this and if we want to make an object then we can make something like this. This is a class and this is an object. Let's take one more example. For example we are making a factory in which we are going to produce cars so we can make a class let's call it car how should every car look like basically in every car, we want to give the color of all the cars blue all my cars will have blue color now we can create our cars, this is my car1 car1 is equal to what we to, we made an object of car and now we can print the color of car1, save it, run it, car1 color is equal to blue. In the same way we can give more parameters to it, for example every car will have some model or it will have some brand. Let's suppose the factory we have created, the brand will be Mercedes. So now if we want to print the brand of our car, we can print it. Let's save and run. So these values will be printed. So this is how a class is created and this is how an object is created. Now next we are going to talk about constructor. Constructor is basically the init function. There is a special function in every class which we call init function or we also call it constructor. This function is invoked during the time of object creation. To is invoked during object creation, invoked means executed. Whenever a new object is created, for example, I created car1, so what happened is that a constructor was executed automatically. If I create car2 tomorrow, then my constructor function will be executed again. Now the interesting thing is that we are not seeing the init function here. So for now let's comment out this, let's come to our simple example, the student example. For example here our class is student, so for student we can create a constructor, all classes have a function called init function which is always executed when the class is being initiated or in fact it should be here when the object is being initiated means as soon as you make a new object using the class automatically the init function will be called now here in our class we have not written any init function so what python does is automatically creates an init function for us and will execute it. Whether you write init function as a programmer or not, the init function will always be executed. There will always be a constructor for us. Now if we have to write the constructor ourselves, then how can we write that init function? We will write our function in the class. First we will write def, then underscore underscore. We will write init, i.e. initialization short init and then underscore underscore we will write init and again underscore underscore which is suggesting vs code this is my init function and for this we will put parenthesis and now we can do any work in this init function for example if I want to print in this, creating new student or practically let's write adding new student in database. Let's write something like this. That what we are doing is adding new student value in our college database. We have written this basically. Let's keep this name above, so now we will notice that as soon as we create our s1 object, the first thing that will happen is that the init function will be called automatically, basically when we write the class name and here we are putting this parenthesis, this parenthesis is used to call the constructor, so automatically this constructor will be called, one more interesting thing about the constructor that the constructor always takes an argument or we can say it takes a parameter which is called the self parameter means if we define our constructor in this way then the first parameter will always be a self parameter so here we have to write self together now what does self mean self means the new object which is being created the new object which we are creating we are calling this self self means I myself so the object on which the constructor calls this is the reference of this means it is pointing towards this so let's save it and run it as such we haven't printed anything what I have written is that I have created a class, it had some name and there was a constructor, I have written only this much in my code, let me delete all of this, in code only this line is written, still what happened, this thing will be printed automatically adding new student in database, why because this constructor gets invoked automatically and gets called automatically. Now let's see what is this self, if we want we can print our self, let's save it and run it, so what is printed? Student object at this location, so basically the student object that we are creating, the self variable that we have taken both the things are same, it is pointing to that, infact if I print here S1, let's save it and run, so what are these two things, this location and this thing, they are both the same things, this object of S1, to which we have given the name S1 internally means the same that we are talking about this S1 object. And now if we want to give different names to different students, then we can take multiple parameters inside the constructor. Like one is our self parameter, self is always the first parameter, after that we can take a full name variable. And here because this is a constructor way we can pass our name here. So let's suppose the first student we want to keep his name as Karan. Now we will not keep the name of every student as Karan. So here what we can do is we can do self.name is equal to full name. So basically what happened here whatever value we pass from here will come in full name and in self, in self basically in S1 student. Name value, name will be created in a new variable in the class in which full name value will be assigned. So when we will do S1.name then its value will be printed with us. Let's save it and run it. So what came in s1.name? current came, I hope we understood this process that we created an object, what we did in object, we created a constructor, if we don't create a constructor then python automatically creates for us, and in constructor we always have to pass an argument which is my self argument, if we don't write this self here then we will get an error. This parameter self is not necessary to be called self. If I want to call it abcd and write abcd here then basically I am giving name to my object, this is an alias that I want to call my object abcd. This code is also completely valid and there will be no error in it. But generally all the programmers are writing self here because if you work on someone else's code also in the company then there should be no confusion that what is exactly the reference here so that's why we will write generally what generally we have to write self here and as such we don't have to create a name from ourselves. So what is self? Self is the reference. In fact, I have written here also, the self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. That means the object we are creating right now, we are talking about that. If we create a new object, then it will be about that. If we create another object, then it will be about that. And it is used to access variables that belong to the class means we can access the variables in the class using self or we can create new variables like we created this name now similarly we can make another student s2 is equal to student we give name to this as arjun and then we will print the name of s2 same work which was done for S1 will be done here we will save it and run it what was printed? first of all for current our constructor must have been called here so it printed this then we printed the name of S1 then second constructor was called here so constructor is called with every new object so here that thing got printed. Then we printed the name of S2, so the name of S2 got printed. So this way our constructor works and this way our self parameter works. With the help of self parameter we can store different different variables or different different data. Ok whatever data we store for object like we stored name for S1 or name for all students, we call them attributes. All the data stored here, we call them attributes. The variables, the data that is stored inside the class or inside the object or we call them variables, we call them attributes in programming here we can also send multiple values like we can send our marks with full name here it is not necessary to call it full name, we can also call it simply name we call it name and this is also called name so when we are writing name here, name means the name which is in the parameter and here self.name means the new thing which is going to be created in the object. Similarly self.marks is equal to marks. This is generally the syntax which we will get to see in many places that is why I am giving the same name. Generally what programmers do is they give the same name to this value and this value so we also add the same habit. So now we can also start sending the student's marks. Let's suppose they scored 97 and they scored 88 so now if we want we can print s2.name along with s2.marks and here we can print s1.marks let's save it and run, so these are our s1's name and marks and these are our s2's name and marks so in this way we create our classes and we can create a constructor in it. When a new object is being created in the constructor then we can pass additional information so that that additional information can be stored with our object. And tomorrow we can access that information from this object and we can use it for some other work. So this is how the concept of object orientation works. We could have stored the same data in the string works. We could have stored the same data in the string, we could have stored the same data of student and marks in the list, we could have stored it in the dictionary, it is not compulsory to use classes and objects. But many times such real life scenarios will come when we have to use classes and objects. But now what we are doing is trying to understand this concept with simple examples, so that that when we have complex problems then we have all this knowledge available. Also we can theoretically divide our constructors into two categories. So one is this constructor and let's make another version of this. Let's suppose I have this additional constructor. So this first one is such a constructor which has only one variable, one parameter which is my self parameter. So such constructors are generally called default constructors. We call them default constructors. If we don't make the default constructors then by default it will be made Python. Means in that definitely this thing won't be printed, means if I write a pass here or print something then it will come in the category of default constructors and the other ones we have are parameterized constructors. Parameterized constructors means that constructor which has some other parameters other than self. So this comes under parameterized constructors category and this comes under default constructors category. And in the same class if we write two constructors, for example we put a call like this, we execute it, so which constructor was executed? That constructor was executed which is matching with your parameters now this default constructor is not matching with our parameters so obviously this function will not run this function will run and generally for a single class we don't make multiple constructors as such we see our need and according to that we define only one constructor so this was all about constructors now we are going to study about attributes. We have two types, already we have seen what attribute means, attribute means any data, any variable like name, marks, these are attribute values for my class. Now whenever we talk about attributes, we have two types of attributes, one is our class attributes which are common for all the objects, which is owned by the class and common for all the objects and one is instance attribute which is different according to each object. For example, we have made a class with the name student, now for student first student 1 will come, student 2 will come, student2 will come, student3 will come, student4 will come. If I have a class called student, so let's suppose this is my student1, this is my student2, this is my student3, this is my student4. Can I say that name will be different for every student? The name of this class can be different from the name of S2 class. This class name can be different from each student, the name of this student can be different from the name of S2, this student can be different from this student, this student can be different from this student, it is not like we will define the name once and all the students will have the same name, it will not happen like this, so all the student objects or student instances, name will be different for all of them, so logically if the name of each student object will be different, then can I say that this name should be an object or an instance attribute. Means it should be a data which should be different for every object. So we define data which is different for every object by doing self. Like we know that every student name will be different and every student marks will be different. So we will write self. So self.name means that every object's name will be different. Self.marks means that self is the reference of object. Means we are defining marks for object. We are defining name for object. So these self.name and self.marks are both instance attributes they will be different for each object second thing, if we have a student named class so this student, this student, this student and this student if we are making the same college database working on the same college system so can I say that the name of that college will be same means this student is also studying in that college this is also studying in that college this is also be same means this student is also studying in that college this is also studying in that college this is also studying in that college this is also studying in that college so for everyone the name of the college will be same so here I will store the name of the college separately here I will store the name of the college separately here the name of the college here the name of the college does it make sense it doesn't make sense at all because what do objects do objects occupy space in their memory objects occupy space in the memory when this object is created and its name will be stored separately for example this object for which we have defined the name as Karan for this we have defined the name as Arjun for this we have defined the name as Tony for this we have defined the name as Bruce so this will also occupy space in the memory this will also occupy space in the memory this will also occupy space in the memory this will also occupy space in memory separately, this will also occupy space separately, every new object occupies space in memory, but if I get to know that for all objects, I have to store the same data, so if I have to make thousand objects, then will I want to store the same attribute 1000 times? not at all, so that's why the common thing we make it a class attribute and we store it in one single time in memory how? like if every student has the same college name, then I will will define the college name in the constructor not as self.something here I will define that my college name is ABC college so for every student the college name will be same if I want I can print the college name like in the last I can print s2.college name let's save it and run so for s2 the name ofge name let's save it and run so for s2 its college name is printed and this variable college name because it is not defined with self that's why it is stored in memory only once if you create 10 objects then also it will be stored in memory only once but because name is different for every object then it will be stored in memory only 10 times because there are different values to store. If marks are different then marks are also different and will be stored differently. So the things which are common for all the objects we make them class attribute and to access class attributes we can simply write class.attribute Like here instead of writing s2.college name I could write student apni class ka naam.college name this also would been completely valid. That would have given us the same value. But if I want to access this name, then for that we access s2.name or s1.name in this way. Okay, here there might be one more doubt in the minds of some students. For example, I have this one student s1. Let's try this. For example, in our student class itself, we have two class attributes. One is the college name and the other is that by default we have written a name value, anonymous. I have written this. What is the name of the student? In class attribute, I have written anonymous and in object in object attribute I passed current. When I will print s1.name here, what should be printed? You can pause here and think and try to guess. By the way, there is no need to guess. When I will run it, I will get current printed. Why will it be printed? Because whenever I have class attribute of same name, what is this? This is a class attribute. When we have class attribute of same name and object attribute of same name, then precedence of object attribute is higher than class attribute. Means if same name is there then object will get preference, it will get higher priority. But we don't do this generally, generally object attribute and class attribute we don't keep same. Generally in that case it is taken let's suppose any object didn't give its name, any student didn't give its name then by default its name will be anonymous. That is basically one of the purposes why you would use it. But in this case it is not making a lot of sense but you must remember that whenever object attribute and class attribute have same value then always object attribute gets higher preference and higher priority in usage next we are going to talk about methods now whatever is our class two things can be stored in class one is data and other is some methods Now whatever our class is, two things can be stored in the class. One is data and the other is some methods. Data means attributes. So basically class is a collection of two things. Attributes and methods. Attributes means what are the properties you have. Methods means what all you can do., I want to make a blueprint of car. So first I will tell you what is the mileage of the car, what is the color of the car, how much CC is the engine of the car, or basically the size of the tire of the car, different things will be told in this way. These are all attributes, its properties. But then I will have to tell you this car runs, how this car starts, how this car stops, how this car's engine starts. We call all our functions as methods. So methods are basically functions that belong to objects. When we have written some functions in the class, we call functions as methods. The functions that are written in the class, we call them methods. So till now now the string methods that we have been reading or the list methods that we have been reading or let's suppose if we have read any dictionary method so how did we get methods for all these? we got methods for all these because all these classes which we used to create objects then we used to use methods for objects so let's suppose we have made this class for class we have defined constructor here and and this way we can define our method. We can write def and we can write our method name in it. We can call ourself and in the methods we write in the class we always write our first self parameter. And then it is our wish that we can use it or not this way we can define our methods and to use it we write our object's name dot our method's name, this way we can execute for example, let me remove this print line for example we can make a method that says hello if I make a method like this which simply says hello or welcome student and in fact we call this method welcome. It says welcome student and for now it is saying welcome student. Let's save it. So here to call welcome student we can write s1.welcome and we can call this method when we call this method we will get an error that welcome takes zero positional arguments but one was given that we are not passing any argument, basically here in welcome we have to write self first means we always write self parameter first, Let's save it and run now. So welcome student is printed for us. Whether we are using self inside or not, we are generally writing self inside every method. Now using self we can access its properties also. Like I can type self.name So it will say welcome student and then student's name will be printed for us. Let's save it and run. So what happened is our whole method got executed. Similarly we can make a method def get marks. This self has come. We can print it. What does this function do? It returns self.marks. It returns self.marks, self.marks is being returned, so here we can print s1.getMarks and execute it, so whatever value is returned will be printed for us, minimize it a bit and when we run it, marks will be printed for us. So in this way we can create our different methods in python and then we run it, marks will be printed for us this way we can create different methods in python and then we can use them for the objects so till now we have revised what we have learned we define our classes this way and create the object this way whenever we make a class, there is a constructor inside it if we have not written constructor as a programmer programmer then python will automatically create a constructor for us. If we want our own constructor then constructor is basically for the initialization of the object. If you want to do something while creating an object, like if we want to create some new attributes then we do that work in constructor. In this way we define our constructor. There are two types of constructors, default and parameterized. In constructor, there are two types of constructors, default and parameterized. In constructor, the first parameter is self parameter which means object instance. And after that we can take different parameters, we can create our attributes, there are two types of attributes. One is class attribute and other is object attribute. Apart from that we create our methods in class, functions in class are called methods in the methods we are always writing self, these methods are the functions of our class like this is my first method, similarly we can make a student object s2 also for that we can call our method again so we have covered the basic important things about classes and objects so let's solve a practice question so the question is telling us to create student class that takes name and marks of 3 subjects so what we can do is we can make a class we will call this student in this basically we will make a constructor we will define our constructor underscore underscore init in init first of all self will come, after that we are told to pass name and then we have to pass 3 subject's marks, either we can pass 3 different variables or we can pass a proper list also, we will try the list method, subjects as arguments in constructor, Then create a method to print the average of all the subjects. So we are going to do all these things. Let's clear our screen. First of all, let's make a class with student name. In student class, let's make a constructor, def init. Self will come in it. We are going to have our name and we will have marks. I am going to assume marks is a list, means when marks will pass, then marks will come in this way, 99, 98, 97 marks will come in this way. Here we can define self.name is equal to this name and self.marks is equal to marks. Let's make a student object and see, s1 is equal to student and pass the values in it. First we can pass the student's name, let's call him Tony Stark and then pass the name of the person lets call him Tony Stark and then we will pass the marks 99, 98, 97 like this so lets save it now the second part is telling us to create a method to print the average so in this we are going to define lets call it get average in this self will come apart from self we don't need to take anything else for average Let's call it get average. It will contain self. We don't need to take anything else apart from self for average. So here, first of all we will calculate the sum. The sum is going to be self dot marks. Or we can run a loop to take the sum of self. We can run a loop, in the beginning sum is equal to 0 for value in marks, I can add all the values in my marks and then print, hi, let's print the name first, hi score is or your average score is sum divided by 3. Here also we will make it self.marks. So basically we have made a method of get average, in method self will come. Before sum we have calculated all the self.marks, the list of all the values of this, and then printed the average. Let's save it and call s1.get average, save and run. Hi Tony Stark, your average score is 98.0, what happened? Average score was calculated for me. Also additionally our attributes like for example this name is my attribute, for S1 this is the object attribute, if tomorrow I have to change this name also, to be changed. Let's suppose I want to change s1.name to ironman and after that if I call s1.averagemarks then I can directly change the value of my attribute. Let's save it and run it. So what happened is that my name is being printed differently here. So in this way it is possible to change the value of our attributes and manipulate them in classes and objects. Next, the concept we will talk about is static methods. Till now, the methods we have seen like our get average method or any other method, these are all non-static methods. Now we are going to talk about a special type of method which are called static methods. Static methods are methods that don't use the self-parameter. Now we are going to talk about a special type of method which are called static methods. Static methods are methods that don't use the self parameter. Till now we have seen that in every method in some way or the other we have to write our self parameter. But if we don't want to use self, for example if I want to make a function hello and I just want to print hello in it. If we write something like this and then we try to use it, if I try to write s1.hello this will give me an error. I run it and I will get an error. Why am I getting an error? Because by default there should be self in hello which we did not write. But in this function there is no sense of self. So that is why we can make it a static method, we can change this method to a special category, so our static methods don't have self parameter and they work at class level, means they don't work at object level, so whenever we make a class, let's suppose this is our class, this is our object 1, this is my object 2, this is my object2, this is my object3 self is used for objects here self means object1, here self means object2, here self means object3 but if you are making a method in which object is not needed like to print hello we are not using any object attribute or anything else so what to do with that, Not at object level, but at class level. So that's why the methods at class level are called static methods. To make static methods we write at the rate static method this is a decorator. What is decorator? We will talk about that now. Basically by writing decorator we are telling that we want to create static method. Then we can normally create our static method normally. Like here to remove error in this hello I have to simply write at the rate static, here it is also being suggested, what is this? It converts a function to be a static method. This is a decorator which converts a normal function to be a static method. Now if I save and run it then there will be no error, it will be simply hello print for us. So this is what we call a decorator in python. Apart from this there are other decorators but decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function without permanently modifying it. To explain it in a simpler language, so basically there is a function which is a decorator which takes function in parameter and also in output So this decorator takes this function and changes its behaviour and returns it This is what decorator is doing We are going to see decorators in future also so no need to worry Basically we have to write static method at the rate to make any normal function static and this static method is a decorator which is changing the behavior of my normal function. If it was a normal function, its behavior has been changed and it has been made a static method. So whenever we have such methods, which do not need self, we can bring them to the class level and for them we can use static method decorator for them next we are going to talk about two important concepts which I will call two pillars of OOPS, two pillars of object orientation basically whenever we study object orientation programming in any language whether you already have C++ background, Java background or you are studying Python in every language there are generally four pillars of object orientation one pillar is abstraction, these are four theoretical definitions it is difficult to remember their names, but their meaning is very easy the more difficult it is for you to remember abstraction as a word it means it is very easy, nothing is there just remembering this word is the most difficult thing just remember that it is English and nothing else abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism these are the 4 pillars on which the whole object orientation is based. We will discuss these in our next part. Now we will discuss abstraction and encapsulation. It is very easy. Abstraction, abstract means basically in English it can be said as hidden or something which is not clear. Like if you have heard the word abstract art abstraction means in programming in OOPS it is hiding the implementation details of a class means in the class what kind of things are being implemented exactly you have hidden that and you are showing the user only important features means the unnecessary things which the user does not need, you have hidden that, for example when a car runs, when an engine starts, then internally what is being processed inside the engine, a driver will never know that, unless and until you go and search for it, but as such when you press the clutch, when you press the accelerator, then as such what is happening inside the see exactly what is happening in the engine what is happening with fuel, how is the combustion working we can see all those things but it is happening internally so what did the car manufacturer do? unnecessary things like what is happening in the engine the driver doesn't really care he just wants to start his car so he hid the unnecessary details and the necessary things he showed only those were shown to the user. This is what abstraction means. For example, if I create a class.car. I have made a class car. Let's suppose I create a function called start. And this function starts the car. So first of all let's take self here and in fact let's make a constructor def constructor init, it will have self and as soon as self comes we will create an accelerator in every car this is my accelerator or let's call it.acc we can create an accelerator in every car in the beginning what is accelerator we can call it false or we have not pressed the accelerator apart from that there can be a break in every car break is a keyword we call it self.brk there is a break in every car in the beginning we have not pressed the brake and in every car we have a clutch in the beginning we have not pressed the clutch so we have defined a car now as we start the car first of all we will pressed the clutch yet so what we have done is defined a car now as we start the car first of all we will press the clutch so our self.clutch value will be equal to true then we will press the accelerator self. don't take it literally we are taking an example and then car will start so we will print car started, we have made a class, normal class car, initialized it, every car has accelerator, brake and clutch in the beginning all are false, no one has been pressed, when we have to start the car then what we have to do, then we have to press clutch also, then we have to press accelerator and car will start, so let's create a car one object is equal to car, in which we have to press clutch and accelerator and car will start so let's create a car1 object is equal to car in which we don't have to pass anything and then I want to start my car let's save it and run it as soon as I wrote my code to start the car car started and it got printed but in the background the unnecessary steps like I trued the clutch first trued the accelerator first, I am not able to understand this here where are all these steps? all these steps are inside the class outside the class there is no unnecessary thing printed outside the class I did not see anything like this which is being implemented internally so assuming that this is an automatic car, these unnecessary details were hidden and only the necessary things which I needed to start the car, I had access to them. This is called abstraction. Here what we did in our code, we implemented abstraction. This is what abstraction is. Basically when you hide unnecessary implementation details in the code and only show the user the necessary user, that is called abstraction. Second is encapsulation. Encapsulation, capsule is an important word. Basically we make a capsule, let me try to create this capsule of data and related functions. We make a capsule of data and related functions in a single unit. What is this? This is my capsule. And this is called encapsulation. Basically we have made a class which has attributes and methods and we are making an object of that and using it. What we have been doing till now, the whole code we have written in this lecture, that was all encapsulation. Whenever we are making a class, we are using, the thing we have been doing till now, the thing we have written the entire code in this lecture, that was all encapsulation, whenever we are making a class it has attributes and methods, what we have done is encapsulation, so encapsulation is wrapping data and the functions into a single unit which is my object, in an object it has related data and related functions and that capsule is my object and we call that encapsulation so abstraction and encapsulation, these are two difficult words of English but their meaning is very simple which we have written the code of classes and objects till now this is abstraction and this is encapsulation nothing is difficult to understand in this, but yes the definition of both of them is very important because interviewer can ask you the definition or if you have an exam in college of python then in that definition is really important, we can remember that, next now lets solve one more practice question, we have to create an account class with two attributes we are talking about a bank account it will have two attributes one is our bank balance and other is our account number we have to create two attributes after that we have to create methods through which we can debit any amount from the account we can credit, debit means to reduce the value from the account, credit means to add in some balance and then we will have another method which prints the balance, so we are going to create all these things, so first of all let's make a class for ourselves, account, in account class first of all all we define our constructor. In this we will have self, apart from that we will have balance, let's call it bl. And after that we will have account number. is equal to this value and self.accountNumber is equal to this value. So if I want to create any account, for example this is my account1 or acc1 for customer 1. So we can set up our account in this way. First we have to pass a balance, we can pass a number in the balance. For example, we have an amount of 10,000 which we have added in our bank account. And then our account number, let's suppose 1, 2, 3, 4 or let's suppose 1, 2, 3, 4,5 this is my account number, this is what we have. Now if we want we can print the balance of account 1 directly and if we want we can print account number for it. So I have successfully created my class and object. Now I have to add three methods in it for debit, credit and printing the balance. First of all we create our debit method. Def debit, in debit we have to use self because whenever amount is debit, means if you want to take anything from bank account then value of balance will decrease and balance is of every object, balance of every account is different, balance of second account is different, balance of third account is different, so here balance and amount will decrease, let's suppose this is the amount that we want to take out from our account it is given. So this is our debit method and in the same way our credit method is going to be. This is my credit method, in this we are going to add an amount, this will be minus equal to, this will be plus equal to, we have added this amount in our balance and here we will write credited, basically this amount has been added and then we will make a function which returns the final balance get balance and this basically returns self.balance in fact if we want we can call here also, like we printed debited and after that we can print Total balance is equal to and here we will call get or. We can print the same thing here. So, by calling our internal method whenever there is an amount debit or credit, we will print our final balance. So, this is my account class it has balance and account number. Then I have done debit, so it has moved away from balance, it came after printing and final balance came. Credit was done, so it was added to balance,, printed and came and the final balance came. Credit was added to the balance, printed and came and the final total balance came. And we have already made an internal function of get balance. Let's try to do some things first. First of all, in the account, let's suppose we want to make a debit. From inside this, I want to take out 1000 rupees from it. After that what I want to do is add 500 rupees in it. So what will happen is that when we will debit 1000 rupees, then here it will print that 1000 rupees was debited. Total balance is 9000. After that we have added 500 in the account so total balance is 9500. After that let's suppose our salary comes at the start of the month. Let's suppose my salary is 40,000. Save it. Let's re-execute. So the 9500 which was added 40,000 becomes 49,500. After that again I have to pay my rent, I might be spending about 10000 and the cycle repeats, the total balance changes. So in this way we have made our class, we have created objects in it, this was a single account, in this way multiple accounts can be created. In fact many people who create starter projects like whenever we learn a first language, like Java, Python, C++, we learn in it, we learn in schools too, we learn in the first year of college too. So the most basic project is that students make a banking system in this way or make some other system in which classes and objects are based on object orientation. In which you make account class in the same way, your balance is getting updated, different things are happening. But this is basically a demo of how objects can relate to real world scenario. Means all these things are fine, we could have made a debit function, we could have made a credit function separately, we could have made a get balance function also. But then for every account, storing its balance, storing its account number, we could have made the get balance function also, but then for every account, storing its balance, its account number, we have to use list somewhere, somewhere we have to use dictionary, somewhere we have to use something else, things get very confusing, but according to a real world scenario, using class and object in this case, in this example makes sense, otherwise we would have get stuck in many different data types. So this is how classes and objects help us logically to organize our code in a well structured manner. So these were the basic things related to classes and objects which we have covered in this part 1. There are many more concepts about which we have talked about like inheritance, polymorphism. In fact, how can we create private attributes, how can we create private methods, how can we delete an attribute. These are small important things which see you in the next lecture, till then keep learning and keep practicing.
