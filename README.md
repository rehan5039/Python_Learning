## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation Guide

#### For Windows Users

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for Windows
   - Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

#### For macOS Users

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for macOS
   - Run the installer package

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

#### For Linux Users

Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To check:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If not installed, use your package manager:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install python3
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

We recommend using **Visual Studio Code** as your code editor:

1. Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the Python extension by Microsoft
3. Create your first Python file with `.py` extension
4. Run your code using the integrated terminal

### Your First Python Program

Let's write your first Python program:

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new file (Ctrl+N or Cmd+N)
3. Save it as `hello.py`
4. Type the following code:

```python
# This is your first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
```
5. Run the program by:
   - Right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal"
   - Or using Ctrl+F5 (Cmd+F5 on Mac)

You should see:
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Python Programming!
```

Congratulations! You've just written your first Python program.
