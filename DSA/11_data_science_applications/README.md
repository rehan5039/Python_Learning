## Key Concepts in Data Science Context

### 1. Time Complexity in Data Processing
```python
# Inefficient approach - O(n*m)
def inefficient_merge(df1, df2):
    result = []
    for _, row1 in df1.iterrows():
        for _, row2 in df2.iterrows():
            if row1['key'] == row2['key']:
                result.append({**row1, **row2})
    return pd.DataFrame(result)

# Efficient approach - O(n log n + m log m)
def efficient_merge(df1, df2):
    return pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key')
```

### 2. Memory Optimization
```python
# Memory-efficient data types
def optimize_dataframe(df):
    for col in df.columns:
        col_type = df[col].dtype
        
        if col_type != object:
            c_min = df[col].min()
            c_max = df[col].max()
            
            if str(col_type)[:3] == 'int':
                if c_min > np.iinfo(np.int8).min and c_max < np.iinfo(np.int8).max:
                    df[col] = df[col].astype(np.int8)
                elif c_min > np.iinfo(np.int16).min and c_max < np.iinfo(np.int16).max:
                    df[col] = df[col].astype(np.int16)
                # ... continue for other int types
```

### 3. Algorithmic Thinking in ML
```python
# Decision tree implementation using tree algorithms
class DecisionTree:
    def __init__(self, max_depth=10):
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.tree = None
    
    def _best_split(self, X, y):
        # Use information gain or Gini impurity
        best_gain = 0
        best_feature = None
        best_threshold = None
        
        for feature_idx in range(X.shape[1]):
            thresholds = np.unique(X[:, feature_idx])
            for threshold in thresholds:
                # Calculate information gain
                gain = self._information_gain(X[:, feature_idx], y, threshold)
                if gain > best_gain:
                    best_gain = gain
                    best_feature = feature_idx
                    best_threshold = threshold
        
        return best_feature, best_threshold
```
