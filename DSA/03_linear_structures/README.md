# Chapter 3: Linear Data Structures

## Overview
In this chapter, we'll explore linear data structures that store elements in a sequential manner. These fundamental structures form the building blocks for many algorithms and applications in computer science and data science.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Lists
- Stacks and their applications
- Queues and their variations
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Deques (Double-ended Queues)
- Implementation details and use cases
- Performance analysis of operations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Implement and use various linear data structures
- Understand the trade-offs between different implementations
- Apply appropriate data structures to solve specific problems
- Analyze the time and space complexity of operations
- Use linear structures in data science applications

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Familiarity with basic data types
