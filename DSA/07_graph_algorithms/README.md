# Chapter 7: Graph Algorithms

## Overview
In this chapter, we'll explore fundamental graph algorithms that are essential for solving complex problems in computer science, network analysis, and data science. Graphs provide a powerful abstraction for modeling relationships and connections in real-world systems.

## Topics Covered
- Graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Minimum spanning tree algorithms (Prim, Kruskal)
- Topological sorting
- Strongly connected components
- Network flow algorithms

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Implement and analyze various graph representations
- Apply graph traversal algorithms to solve problems
- Implement shortest path algorithms for different scenarios
- Understand and implement minimum spanning tree algorithms
