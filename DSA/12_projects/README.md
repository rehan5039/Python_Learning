## Project Structure
Each project includes:
- **Problem Statement** - Clear description of what needs to be built
- **Requirements** - Technical specifications and constraints
- **Implementation** - Complete working code with documentation
- **Testing** - Comprehensive test cases and validation
- **Optimization** - Performance improvements and best practices
- **Extension Ideas** - Suggestions for further development

## Getting Started
1. Choose a project based on your current skill level
2. Read the problem statement and requirements carefully
3. Plan your implementation approach
4. Code the solution incrementally
5. Test thoroughly with various inputs
