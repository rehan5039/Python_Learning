# Chapter 4: Non-Linear Data Structures

## Overview
In this chapter, we'll explore non-linear data structures that organize data in hierarchical or interconnected ways. These structures are essential for representing complex relationships and are widely used in computer science and data science applications.

## Topics Covered
- Trees and their variations (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Graphs and their representations
- Hash Tables and Dictionaries
- Advanced tree structures (B-Trees, Trie, etc.)
- Implementation details and use cases
- Performance analysis of operations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Implement and use various non-linear data structures
- Understand the trade-offs between different implementations
- Apply appropriate data structures to solve specific problems
- Analyze the time and space complexity of operations
- Use non-linear structures in data science applications

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Knowledge of complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Familiarity with Python programming
