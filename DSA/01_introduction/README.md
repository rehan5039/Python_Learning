## 📝 What are Data Structures?

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, and storing data efficiently. They define the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.

### Key Characteristics
- **Organization**: How data is arranged in memory
- **Access Patterns**: How data is retrieved and modified
- **Efficiency**: Time and space complexity of operations
- **Use Cases**: When to use each data structure

## 🤖 What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or completing tasks. They take input, process it according to defined rules, and produce output.

### Key Characteristics
- **Input**: Data provided to the algorithm
- **Output**: Result produced by the algorithm
- **Definiteness**: Each step is precisely defined
- **Finiteness**: Algorithm terminates after finite steps
- **Effectiveness**: Each step is executable

## 🐍 Python Data Structures Overview

### 1. Lists (Dynamic Arrays)
```python
# Creation and basic operations
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)  # Add element
first = numbers[0]  # Access element
```

**Time Complexities:**
- Access by index: O(1)
- Append: O(1) amortized
- Insert/Delete at beginning: O(n)
- Search: O(n)

### 2. Dictionaries (Hash Maps)
```python
# Creation and basic operations
student_grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92}
grade = student_grades["Alice"]  # Access
student_grades["Charlie"] = 78  # Insert/Update
```

**Time Complexities:**
- Access: O(1) average
- Insert: O(1) average
- Delete: O(1) average

### 3. Sets (Hash Sets)
```python
# Creation and basic operations
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
unique_numbers.add(6)  # Add element
```

**Time Complexities:**
- Add: O(1) average
- Remove: O(1) average
- Search: O(1) average

### 4. Tuples (Immutable Sequences)
```python
# Creation and basic operations
coordinates = (10, 20)
x = coordinates[0]  # Access element
```

**Time Complexities:**
- Access by index: O(1)
- Creation: O(n)

## 🔍 Algorithm Analysis Basics

### Time Complexity
Measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size.

**Common Notations:**
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time

### Space Complexity
Measures how much memory an algorithm uses relative to input size.

## 🎮 Practical Examples

### Linear Search
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n)

### Binary Search (Sorted Array)
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

## 🧪 Data Science Application

### Efficient Data Processing
```python
def process_large_dataset(data):
    # Using dictionary for O(1) lookups
    processed_data = {}
    
    # Using set for unique values
    unique_categories = set()
    
    for record in data:
        category = record.get('category')
        value = record.get('value', 0)
        
        # Efficient aggregation
        if category in processed_data:
            processed_data[category] += value
        else:
            processed_data[category] = value
        
        # Track unique categories
        unique_categories.add(category)
    
    return processed_data
```
