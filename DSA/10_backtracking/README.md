# Chapter 10: Backtracking

## Overview
Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that systematically searches for solutions to computational problems by incrementally building candidates and abandoning partial candidates as soon as it's determined they cannot lead to a valid solution. This chapter explores the principles and applications of backtracking algorithms.

## Backtracking Framework
```python
def backtrack(candidate):
    if is_solution(candidate):
        process_solution(candidate)
        return
    
    for next_candidate in generate_candidates(candidate):
        if is_valid(next_candidate):
            make_move(next_candidate)
            backtrack(next_candidate)
            undo_move(next_candidate)
```

## Key Concepts
1. **State Space Tree**: Representation of all possible solutions
2. **Pruning**: Eliminating branches that cannot lead to valid solutions
3. **Constraint Propagation**: Using constraints to reduce search space
4. **Branch and Bound**: Combining backtracking with optimization techniques

## Example: N-Queens Problem
```python
def solve_n_queens(n):
    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        # Check column
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i] == col:
                return False
        
        # Check diagonals
        for i in range(row):
            if abs(board[i] - col) == abs(i - row):
                return False
        
        return True
    
    def backtrack(board, row):
        if row == n:
            return [board[:]]  # Found a solution
        
        solutions = []
        for col in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, row, col):
                board[row] = col
                solutions.extend(backtrack(board, row + 1))
                board[row] = -1  # Backtrack
        
        return solutions
    
    return backtrack([-1] * n, 0)

# Example usage
solutions = solve_n_queens(4)
print(f"Number of solutions for 4-Queens: {len(solutions)}")
```

## Optimization Techniques
1. **Constraint Checking**: Validate moves early to prune search space
2. **Symmetry Breaking**: Eliminate symmetric solutions
3. **Heuristic Ordering**: Order choices to find solutions faster
4. **Memoization**: Cache results of subproblems
5. **Look-ahead**: Predict future constraints

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: Usually exponential in the worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(d) where d is the maximum depth of recursion
- **Average Case**: Highly dependent on problem constraints and pruning effectiveness
