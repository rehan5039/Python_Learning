# Chapter 8: Dynamic Programming

## Overview
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties. This chapter will teach you how to identify DP problems and implement efficient solutions.

## Topics Covered
- Memoization vs. Tabulation
- Fibonacci sequence optimization
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Knapsack problem variants
- Matrix chain multiplication
- Optimal binary search trees
- Edit distance (Levenshtein distance)
- Coin change problem
- Subset sum problem

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Identify problems suitable for dynamic programming
- Implement both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches
- Solve classic DP problems efficiently
- Analyze time and space complexity of DP solutions
- Apply DP techniques to real-world scenarios
- Optimize recursive solutions using DP

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of recursion and backtracking
- Knowledge of basic data structures (arrays, matrices)
- Familiarity with algorithm analysis (Big O notation)
- Basic Python programming skills

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence
```python
# Naive recursive approach - O(2^n) time complexity
def fibonacci_naive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_naive(n-1) + fibonacci_naive(n-2)

# Memoized approach - O(n) time complexity
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Tabulated approach - O(n) time complexity
def fibonacci_tab(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```
