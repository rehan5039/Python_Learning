## Key Concepts

### Deep Neural Networks
Deep neural networks consist of multiple hidden layers that enable learning of complex patterns:
- Input layer → Hidden layers → Output layer
- Each layer applies transformations to extract higher-level features
- Backpropagation for training with gradient descent
- Activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) introduce non-linearity

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images:
- Convolutional layers extract spatial features
- Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions
- Fully connected layers for final classification
- Popular architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequential data processing:
- Hidden state captures information from previous time steps
- Variants: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU
- Applications: Time series forecasting, NLP, speech recognition
- Challenges: Vanishing gradient problem, long-term dependencies

### Transformers
Revolutionary architecture based on attention mechanisms:
- Self-attention computes relationships between all positions
- Encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks
- Pre-trained models: BERT, GPT, T5
- State-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks

## Example: Simple CNN with TensorFlow
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and preprocess data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Build CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, 
                    epochs=5, 
                    batch_size=32,
                    validation_split=0.1,
                    verbose=1)

# Evaluate model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")

# Visualize training history
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Best Practices
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure high-quality, diverse datasets with proper preprocessing
2. **Architecture Selection**: Choose appropriate architectures for your problem domain
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers
4. **Regularization**: Apply dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation
5. **Monitoring**: Track training/validation metrics to detect overfitting
6. **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models for faster training and better performance
7. **Model Evaluation**: Use appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques
