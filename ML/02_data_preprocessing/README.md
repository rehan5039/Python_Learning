# Chapter 2: Data Preprocessing

## Overview
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for modeling. High-quality preprocessing can significantly improve model performance and reduce training time.

## Topics Covered
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering and selection
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Data transformation techniques
- Pipeline creation for reproducible preprocessing
