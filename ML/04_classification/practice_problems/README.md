2. Compare their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. Analyze which algorithm performs best for this specific problem
4. Explain why certain algorithms might be more suitable than others

### Problem 2: Hyperparameter Tuning
**Scenario**: Your SVM model is not performing well on a text classification task.

**Tasks**:
1. Perform grid search to find optimal hyperparameters for SVM
2. Compare performance before and after tuning
3. Analyze the impact of different kernel functions
4. Visualize the effect of hyperparameters on model performance

### Problem 3: Handling Imbalanced Data
**Scenario**: You're building a fraud detection system where fraudulent transactions are rare (1% of data).

**Tasks**:
1. Implement techniques to handle class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights, etc.)
2. Compare model performance with and without balancing techniques
3. Evaluate using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets
4. Discuss the trade-offs between different approaches
