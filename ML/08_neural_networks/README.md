# Chapter 8: Neural Networks

## Overview
Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain that consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" working together to solve complex problems. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of neural networks, their architecture, and practical implementations.

## Topics Covered
- Biological inspiration and artificial neurons
- Perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons
- Activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU)
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent and optimization techniques
- Network architectures and hyperparameter tuning
- Overfitting and regularization techniques
- Practical implementation with TensorFlow/Keras

## Learning Objectives

## Example: Simple Neural Network
```python
import numpy as np

# Simple neural network with one hidden layer
class SimpleNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        # Initialize weights randomly
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def sigmoid(self, x):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    
    def forward(self, X):
        self.z1 = np.dot(X, self.W1)
        self.a1 = self.sigmoid(self.z1)
        self.z2 = np.dot(self.a1, self.W2)
        self.a2 = self.sigmoid(self.z2)
        return self.a2

# Create and use the network
nn = SimpleNeuralNetwork(2, 3, 1)
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
output = nn.forward(X)
print("Network output:", output)
```
