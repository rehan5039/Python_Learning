# Practice Problems: Neural Networks

## Overview
This folder contains hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of neural networks covered in Chapter 8. Each problem is designed to help you apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementations.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Activation Function Implementation
**Scenario**: You need to implement and compare different activation functions for a neural network.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement the Softplus activation function (smooth approximation of ReLU)
2. Compare the derivatives of ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Softplus
3. Analyze when each activation function might be preferred
4. Visualize all activation functions on the same plot

### Problem 2: Network Architecture Design
**Scenario**: Design a neural network architecture for a specific problem.

**Tasks**:
1. Design a network for image classification (28x28 grayscale images, 10 classes)
2. Calculate the total number of parameters in your network
3. Explain your choice of activation functions for each layer
4. Propose regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

### Problem 3: Training Algorithm Comparison
**Scenario**: Compare different optimization algorithms for training a neural network.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement Momentum-based Gradient Descent
2. Compare convergence speed of Gradient Descent, Momentum, and Adam
3. Analyze the impact of different learning rates
4. Visualize the loss curves for each optimizer

### Problem 4: Backpropagation Implementation
**Scenario**: Implement backpropagation for a custom neural network.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement the backward pass for a 3-layer network
2. Verify your implementation with gradient checking
3. Handle different activation functions in backpropagation
4. Test with different loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy)

### Problem 5: Practical Network Training
**Scenario**: Train a neural network on a real dataset.

**Tasks**:
1. Preprocess a dataset for neural network training
2. Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
3. Use validation data to tune hyperparameters
4. Evaluate your model's performance with appropriate metrics
