## Example: End-to-End ML Project
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

class MLProject:
    def __init__(self, project_name):
        self.project_name = project_name
        self.data = None
        self.model = None
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        
    def load_data(self, file_path):
        """Load data from file."""
        self.data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        print(f"Data loaded: {self.data.shape}")
        
    def preprocess_data(self, target_column):
        """Preprocess data for modeling."""
        # Separate features and target
        X = self.data.drop(columns=[target_column])
        y = self.data[target_column]
        
        # Handle missing values
        X = X.fillna(X.mean())
        
        # Scale features
        X_scaled = self.scaler.fit_transform(X)
        
        return X_scaled, y
    
    def train_model(self, X, y):
        """Train machine learning model."""
        # Split data
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
        )
        
        # Train model
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        # Evaluate model
        y_pred = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
        
        print(f"Model trained. Test accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
        print("\nClassification Report:")
        print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
        
        return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
    
    def predict(self, X):
        """Make predictions on new data."""
        if self.model is None:
            raise ValueError("Model not trained yet")
        
        X_scaled = self.scaler.transform(X)
        return self.model.predict(X_scaled)

# Usage example
# project = MLProject("Customer Churn Prediction")
# project.load_data("customer_data.csv")
# X, y = project.preprocess_data("churn")
# project.train_model(X, y)
```

## Best Practices for ML Projects
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with baseline models before complex approaches
2. **Version Control**: Use Git for code and DVC for data versioning
3. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds and document environments
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed project documentation
5. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for data and model components
6. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for data and model drift
7. **Ethics**: Consider bias, fairness, and privacy implications
8. **Collaboration**: Use collaborative tools and clear communication
