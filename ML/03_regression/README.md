# Chapter 3: Regression

## Overview
Regression is a fundamental supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values. This chapter covers various regression algorithms, from simple linear regression to advanced ensemble methods, along with evaluation metrics and practical implementation strategies.

## Topics Covered
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Ensemble methods for regression
- Model evaluation and validation
- Hyperparameter tuning for regression models

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand and implement various regression algorithms
- Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Evaluate regression models using appropriate metrics
- Perform feature selection and engineering for regression
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance
- Handle common regression challenges (multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity)
- Deploy regression models in real-world scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming skills
- Understanding of NumPy and Pandas
