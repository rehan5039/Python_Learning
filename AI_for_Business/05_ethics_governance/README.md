## Real-World Applications
- **Healthcare**: Ensuring fair treatment recommendations across patient demographics
- **Finance**: Preventing discriminatory lending practices and fraud detection
- **Human Resources**: Fair hiring and promotion algorithms
- **Marketing**: Responsible personalization and targeting
- **Customer Service**: Ethical chatbots and virtual assistants
- **Supply Chain**: Fair supplier selection and optimization
- **Risk Management**: Balanced risk assessment models
- **Product Development**: Inclusive design and testing

## Key Concepts

### Ethical AI Principles
Fundamental principles that guide responsible AI development:
- **Fairness**: Ensuring equitable treatment across all groups
- **Transparency**: Making AI decision-making processes understandable
- **Accountability**: Establishing clear responsibility for AI outcomes
- **Privacy**: Protecting individual data and rights
- **Safety**: Ensuring AI systems operate reliably and securely
- **Beneficence**: Maximizing benefits while minimizing harm

### Bias in AI Systems
Types of bias and mitigation strategies:
- **Selection Bias**: Non-representative training data
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Discriminatory model behavior
- **Confirmation Bias**: Reinforcing existing prejudices
- **Automation Bias**: Over-reliance on AI recommendations
- **Deployment Bias**: Contextual mismatches in application

### Privacy and Data Protection
Essential considerations for data handling:
- **Data Minimization**: Collecting only necessary information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Using data only for intended purposes
- **Consent Management**: Obtaining and managing user permissions
- **Data Security**: Protecting against unauthorized access
- **Right to Explanation**: Providing understandable AI decisions
- **Right to Erasure**: Allowing data deletion requests

## Example: Bias Detection Framework
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

class BiasDetector:
    def __init__(self, sensitive_attributes):
        self.sensitive_attributes = sensitive_attributes
    
    def calculate_demographic_parity(self, y_pred, sensitive_data):
        """Calculate demographic parity across groups."""
        groups = sensitive_data.unique()
        parity_rates = {}
        
        for group in groups:
            mask = sensitive_data == group
            group_pred = y_pred[mask]
            parity_rates[group] = np.mean(group_pred)
        
        # Calculate disparity
        rates = list(parity_rates.values())
        disparity = max(rates) - min(rates) if rates else 0
        
        return {
            'per_group': parity_rates,
            'disparity': disparity
        }
    
    def calculate_equal_opportunity(self, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_data):
        """Calculate equal opportunity (true positive rate parity)."""
        groups = sensitive_data.unique()
        opportunity_rates = {}
        
        for group in groups:
            mask = sensitive_data == group
            group_true = y_true[mask]
            group_pred = y_pred[mask]
            
            # True positive rate
            if np.sum(group_true == 1) > 0:
                tpr = recall_score(group_true, group_pred)
            else:
                tpr = 0
            
            opportunity_rates[group] = tpr
        
        # Calculate disparity
        rates = list(opportunity_rates.values())
        disparity = max(rates) - min(rates) if rates else 0
        
        return {
            'per_group': opportunity_rates,
            'disparity': disparity
        }

# Usage example
# detector = BiasDetector(['gender', 'ethnicity'])
# parity_result = detector.calculate_demographic_parity(predictions, sensitive_attributes)
# opportunity_result = detector.calculate_equal_opportunity(true_labels, predictions, sensitive_attributes)
```

## Governance Framework Components
