## Facilitation Techniques

### Encouraging Participation
- Use round-robin sharing to ensure everyone contributes
- Ask open-ended questions rather than yes/no questions
- Acknowledge and build on participant contributions
- Create a safe environment for sharing diverse perspectives
- Use polling or quick surveys for anonymous input

### Managing Group Dynamics
- Monitor for dominant voices and encourage quieter participants
- Redirect off-topic discussions back to the scenario focus
- Handle conflicts constructively by focusing on ideas, not people
- Ensure all groups have equal time and attention
- Provide breaks for longer sessions

### Addressing Challenges
- **Technical Questions**: Acknowledge limitations and suggest research paths
- **Skepticism**: Present balanced views with both benefits and challenges
- **Overwhelm**: Break complex topics into manageable components
- **Dominant Participants**: Use structured activities to distribute participation
- **Time Management**: Use clear time signals and gentle transitions
