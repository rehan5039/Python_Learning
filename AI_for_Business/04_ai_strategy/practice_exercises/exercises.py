    Exercise: AI Strategy Alignment
    =========================
    
    Situation:
    You are a strategic planning consultant working with MediCare Plus, a mid-sized
    healthcare provider network with 50 clinics across three states. The organization
    has recognized the need to develop an AI strategy to remain competitive and
    improve patient outcomes while reducing costs.
    
    Current Business Context:
    - Revenue challenges due to increasing competition and reimbursement pressures
    - Patient satisfaction scores declining (currently 72%, industry average 78%)
    - Operational inefficiencies in scheduling and administrative processes
    - Need to improve clinical decision-making and patient care quality
    - Growing demand for telehealth and digital health services
    
    Organizational Challenges:
    - Limited AI expertise and capabilities within the organization
    - Aging IT infrastructure with limited integration capabilities
    - Data silos across different systems and departments
    - Conservative culture with resistance to rapid technological change
    - Budget constraints and need to demonstrate clear ROI
    
    Exercise Objectives:
    1. Align AI initiatives with MediCare Plus business objectives
    2. Develop a compelling AI vision statement
    3. Create specific, measurable AI goals
    4. Identify key strategic connections between AI and business strategy
