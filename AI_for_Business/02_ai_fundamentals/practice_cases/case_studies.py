    Case Study: Healthcare Diagnosis Assistant
    ====================================
    
    Scenario:
    MedTech Solutions, a mid-sized healthcare technology company, is developing
    an AI-powered diagnostic assistant for radiology departments. The system
    aims to help radiologists detect early-stage lung cancer from CT scans
    with higher accuracy and speed.
    
    Business Context:
    - Radiologists face increasing workloads and shortage in the industry
    - Early detection of lung cancer significantly improves patient outcomes
    - Healthcare systems are under pressure to reduce costs while improving care
    - Regulatory requirements for medical AI systems are stringent
    
    Current Challenges:
    - Radiologists miss 5-15% of lung cancer cases in initial screenings
    - Reading each CT scan takes 15-30 minutes
    - High volume of scans leads to fatigue and potential errors
    - Specialist radiologists are expensive and in short supply
    
    AI Opportunity:
    - Computer vision algorithms can analyze CT scans for suspicious nodules
    - Machine learning models can flag cases requiring immediate attention
    - Natural language processing can generate preliminary reports
    - Integration with existing hospital information systems
