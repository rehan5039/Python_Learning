## Key Concepts

### What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:
- Learning from experience
- Understanding natural language
- Recognizing patterns and images
- Making decisions and solving problems
- Adapting to new situations

### Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI (ANI)**: Designed for specific tasks (current state of AI)
2. **General AI (AGI)**: Human-level intelligence across all domains (future goal)
3. **Superintelligence**: Beyond human intelligence (theoretical)

### Machine Learning Categories
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards

## Business Impact Framework
- **Efficiency**: Automating routine tasks and processes
- **Effectiveness**: Improving decision quality and accuracy
- **Experience**: Enhancing customer and employee interactions
- **Innovation**: Creating new products, services, and business models
